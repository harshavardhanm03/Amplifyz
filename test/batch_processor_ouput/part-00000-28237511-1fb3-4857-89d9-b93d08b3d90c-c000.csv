2013-11-24,5.0,1,2,3,akg k142 high definition headphones,let me get started by saying that i have gone through enough pairs of headphones to know what sounds good and what does not i have had sonys beats sennheisers boses skullcandys shures and those god awful ipod earbuds anyone who is comparing these to the beats or boses has no idea what theyre talking about the beats are created in part by a rapper who can make awesome songs but with no knowledge of advanced sound engineering and a company that prides itself on selling audio cables at 4 times their competitors prices which have been proven by high school physics class to work identically to a unwound coat hanger why do they sound 34good34 then because the bass is highly exaggerated and the closed port design allows for good isolation they are a fashion accessory and more of an acoustic parlor trick than real audio equipment boses cans do exactly the same thing as the beats but are marketed to wealthy business travelers instead of aspiring rappers as a general rule of thumb look at how marketed the brand is companies have a set budget some of this will go to headphone manufacturing and development and some will go to marketing and product placement if a company spends lots of money on marketing and product placement guess what they are spending less on the actual headphonesbr the sound quality of these is absolutely amazing the closest thing i have heard is my old sennheiser hd 555s which these blew out of the water for a fraction of the price although the sennheisers were more comfortable the bass response is perfect in my opinion it doesnt muddy up or overpower any mids or highs and is accurate yet powerful this is due to the semi open construction a highly underrated design

2012-01-21,5.0,1,9,10,apc smartups 750va ups battery backup with pure sine wave output smt750,to the above reviewer all you had to do is just take the 20 amp plug off and put a 15 amp plug on sure you can not use the full load capacity but your run time will be great i modded my own smart upa 2200va over 7 years ago i am on my second set of batteries with this thing it still runs stable very few pieces of manmade equipment can you say this about so do not let the plug deter you or others plus it has full sinewave output not stepped sinewave for example with a stepped sinewave output on battery power alone if you plug a florescent bulb into it the bulb would turn on and off if you were using a regular light bulb you might see it go dimbrightdimbright the stepped sine wave output is a approximation of ac alternating current but the sine wave is virtually identical to the power that comes out of the wall sine wave output requires more expensive electronicsbr br update 1202012br br my old apc 2200 finally died after 13 years of use i purchased an in family replacement smt2200 modded the plug and put a 15 amp plug on i hope this new model gives me just as long as use as the last onebr br still 5 stars so far

2012-08-06,4.0,1,0,0,acoustic research mission style wireless outdoor speaker aw825  bronze,i wanted an outside speaker solution to integrate with the airtunes function of the apple airport express  i split the output ofmy airport express so one goes to a stereo receiver and the other to the transmitter for this system  if you have an iphone with the remote app installed you can control airtunes remotely which creates a fairly sophisticated system easily  the sound is fine especially for an outside system used to provide background music  the construction is adequate but nothing special it is mostly plastic which will probably chip or crack if dropped from table height  the transmission range is fine and the sound is clear i havent had any interference issues  the speaker can be powered by batteries or the supplied ac converter  i like the wireless aspect because the speaker can be moved to where the activity is which cant be done with permanently mounted speakers  my only complaint is for the price it should include a second speaker unit in fact it is designed to work with either one or two speakers
2014-01-04,4.0,1,1,1,acoustic research portable wireless bluetooth outdoor speaker,i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband  i was very nervous as he does a ton of research before buying anything  i knew i wanted to get him some sort of bluetooth speaker to use outside while doing yardwork  we have a dock speaker which did the job however the phone or ipod would overheat while outside which defeated the purpose  he fired this up within moments of opening the gift and decided it was good sound  it went back into the box until this afternoon when we paired it with both of our iphone 4ss and he announced that it was a great gift  havent been able to use it outdoors yet as theres snow on the ground  we will more than likely use it plugged in with the ac adapter that came with it rather than batteries just personal preference  just redeemed the skinitcom offer this afternoon too  overall great speaker for the price

2014-08-29,4.0,1,3,3,aduro bta1 bluetooth adapter wireless receiver with a2dp technology  for home stereo  portable speakers  headphones  car music sound systems   more 35mm media devices,generally speaking it works as advertised  small and compact easy to pair with a phone or tablet  sound quality is fine  the only concern i have is that it is not set up well for long time playing  the battery will last a few hours then you have to recharge it  i guess you could leave the recharger on all the time  also the recharging cord is just a usb to miniusb cord  if you have a laptop to plug into you might charge it that way  otherwise you would have to have something to plug the usb cord into  for example a phone charger  but the price is right i guess
2015-04-02,5.0,1,1,1,aftershokz sportz m2 open ear sports headphones with inline microphone  black,i ordered this item because it is the only headphones we are allowed to wear at work i work in an auto plant and there is a very big safety concern when employees wear earphones and are unable to hear what is going on in a dangerous environment there are alarms bells robots and moving parts everywhere and you need full use of all your senses these headphones were loud enough that i was able to hear the music comfortably through all the plant noise but still able to differentiate all the sounds around me in the plant during the times i was at the gym with friends they also never complain of hearing loud music coming from my headphones while working out next to mebr br i absolutely treasure my headphones and keep them in the case whenever they are not in use many of my work peers that have the same pair have not taken care of them as i have and most of their earphones have broken they do feel a little fragile so one tip i have to share is after noticing the few areas that were broken on my peers set i saw a pattern in the common areas where the item was most fragile and i applied black electrical tape to that area to help reinforce it first the area where the wire comes off the ear piece right wear it is attached i put black tape around that around and you cant even see it unless you are looking for it i also put a small amount of black tape around the seam where the piece sits above your ear in that area you will see a seam and it seems as if you are able to pull the two pieces apart dont pull them apart just tape it to reinforce it if you want i did this before my first use and they are still in perfect condition and i have had them for i think  almost 3 months now
2000-01-20,4.0,1,1,1,aiwa hpx111 stereo headphones,i wear these headphone virtually 8 hrs a day every day of the week  the padding around the ears makes them very comfortable  the sound quality was very weak when i initially started using thembut i added a plugin called  arboretum realizer for winamp and it really boosted the quality  if you  listen to mp3s on these headphones you should try it
2003-04-16,3.0,1,0,1,aiwa headphones,these phones are one of the best looking phones on the market even though it is just all plastic construction quality was good though one cushion was sewed differently than the other but what can you expect for inexpensiveheadphonesi bought it due to one magazine saying it sounded very good but i found it not airy sounding at all especially in the bass due to its open back it sounded pretty plain like any other cheap headphone but im no headphone expert and i havent listened to other phones very much to compare i did have a koss esp950 and if i recall the one song i compared it with i wasnt drawn into it like i remember where i wanted to listen to it over and over thats when i think i changed my mind maybe you might find it different as all our musical taste and ears differ at a  dollar level it might sound a tad better than the rest at that level if not its at least one goodlooking headphone

2010-09-19,3.0,1,1,1,aluratek airmm01f internet radio alarm clock with builtin wifi black discontinued by manufacturer,i just discovered internet radio and i am delighted with the amount of programs there arebr i started to enjoy it when i purchased the aluratek jukebox usb stick that plugged into the notebook  i was on my waybr after reading about free standing radios i was hooked so i ordered the aluratek airmm01 clock radiobr after fooling around with it i figured out that i needed to put in my web address and whithin minutes the first station id showed followed by the horizontal streaming signal bar that filled in and music started playing i was hookedbr what bothered me however are a few foibbles that prevent me from embracing the radio completely and like many here i hungered for information about the issues and features the radio presentsbr the radio has been designed by geeks for geeks and is not friendly to anyone that knows little about computersbr the connections in the back are laid out well and make it possible to connect the radio to a stereo for a much improved sound this may be beneficial when some stations broadcast high quality streaming otherwise the built in speaker does the job wellas well as any other little table radio would for newstalk etc an earphone connection is available as well as an ethernet connection for wired needs another input is available for the supplied wire for fm reception in addition the company has included 3 versions of turning the power off as i see it on the left rear is a push button switch that seems to power the complete radio on or off then there is a power switch on the remote control and finally a recessed reset switch on the rear of the unit for makimg sure that a reset is available the fourth version is pulling the plug i suppose when the set acts goofy it must be denied electricity for a short timebr when the radio is turned on the display shows the internet indicators after it connects and gets the ip address it can also go straight to the last station that was left on when the remote power is used yet this is not always the case at least that is how experienced it im not going to delve into the depths of the various steps needed to get the stationsbr im still enthralled with the whole internet radio conceptbr the disillusionment is finding a favorite station again i realize men are hunters but this is ridiculous a favorite mode has been provided yet anytime a station is put in as a favorite it can pile up with many others on the list so if i have a 50 stations in my repetoire and i had the last one on it wont be there the next time its an adventure i tell youbr the radio has been in my possession for about a week now and im still learning about itbr it was moved to the bedroom far from the router and i found a location where the streaming bar was showing a strong signal it was a delightful discovery the next day the reception struggledbr with a blue display even in the darkest setting the room can still be lighted up so that may be an issue to somebr the remotewell i wish it would have a broader angle of transmission that it would have an led to indicate that it was pressed correctly or that the radio itself would acknowledge a transmission was sent this would set my mind at ease that the internal workings are working and that im not rushing its little brain inside we all know how computers behave when they are rushed they freeze up okay im nitpicking yet if i was a designer these things would be on my mind there are no tone controls yet an equalizer feature that indicates different settings offers a variation in sound i could not detect any difference in the changes thoughbr the fm feature is a nice supplement should the net should ever crash thats all i can say about the fm most fm station also stream by the waybr br i actually like the radio and i will fool around with it more to get a greater benefit out of its featuresbr at this time i need to address several issuesbr im stumped by the fact that the radio defaults to clock mode after about a minute i want to see the name of the station and artist if possible and thats how it was when i first got it and the scrolling is not smooth its too step like and thats annoyingbr the next step is to extend the range of the reception the radio is supplied with a removable antenna so i may put a better one on or do likewise to the routers im not eager to spend too much money yet the reception must be improvedbr an included instruction cd was finally looked at and that provides information in greater depth yet it didnt resolve my clock display issue or perhaps im to dense to see itbr ive tried to watch the cd instructions on 3 different dvd players and they never acknowledge it then duhi realized that i have a computerbr a firm ware update that i havent followed up on yet will be done soon i dont know what that will mean yet its nice to know updating is possiblebr br its still a good product its just difficult to operate if left alone for an extended time by a person that forgets all too wellck mode after about a minute i want to see the name of the

2002-09-20,4.0,1,28,28,apple ipod 20 gb white m8741lla 2nd generation  discontinued by manufacturer,at this point i have had my ipod for a week i went with the 10gb model but now i think i might go and buy the 20gb modelbrit is just that goodbr prosbr the ipod itself is a great product  i have owned three previous mp3 players inlcuding the a rio and a compaq  i always felt shortchanged i gave them away or sold them because i didnt like thembr the ipod is what all mp3 players should be like  i had no hitches installing the software and getting songs loaded  cant say that for the my previous 3  something important to me was that other mp3 players dont seem to be able to drown out outside sound sources   the ipod gets loud enough to drown out sound and more  i have nothing bad to say about the ipod itself it is sleek small has tons of space and the firewire connection downloads at blazing speed compared to a usbbrthis is an outstanding product although pricey but well worth every pennybr consbr to find something wrong with the ipod youll have to look at the software it comes bundled with  musicmatch has made a decent attempt at software for the ipod but it does fall short  it doesnt download the tag information for mp3s correctly  therefore you will see misspelled artists and repeated names on your ipod screen even when they dont show that way on the computer  to fix this i found deleting the tag completely just editing it doesnt always work and then recreating the tag for each song fixes the problem  however be warned when you delete the tag information for a song musicmatch will place it at the top of the list in your music library screen and file it under miscellaneous  all you have to do is go there and recreate the tag and musicmatch will place it in its proper place  also musicmatch will truncate band and song names for no apparent reason  fixing this isnt too bad for one song but since the ipods can carry thousands of songs this is a real problem  i must say though that musicmatch does allow you to edit and recreate tag information for multiple files at once  so this helps a little when editing entire albums  but the software developers at musicmatch have let the public down by letting this one slide through  dont you guys test your software before you put it on the shelf  how could you guys have missed that  i develop software by the waybr there are other bugs in musicmatch but i wont go into them here  the one described above is the real annoying one musicmatch would be well advised to take care of this soon

2013-11-20,3.0,1,9,11,apple ipod nano 16gb 7th generation,i purchased the nano after returning another kind of mp3 player which had bad construction poor interface and weak soundbr br the nano solves all those problems the construction is durable and feels like it is built to last the size is very convenient for carrying around the screen is bright making the icons easy to see and the touchscreen works extremely well i wish they could make the font a little bigger to help older users like mebr br sound quality is very good i love the eq settings which i tinker with often the crossfade feature is neat but not something i use often i wish the volume was a little higher    when i plug this into the car stereo i have to max the volume on the nano and crank up the stereo to hear itbr br so why did i give this three stars three problemsbr br first the location of the headphone port drives me nuts they stuck it on the bottom of the nano rather than the top this means you tupically hold the device upside down  because the headphone cord runs down into your hand uncomfortably if you hold it rightside up i frequently disconnect my headphones accidentally when i turn the device around to navigate the touchscreen its even worse when you are plugged into your car stereo and are more inclined to use the touchscreen with one hand ive gotten to the point where i just disconnect the device from the cable before i try to change songs or adjust settings then plug it back in when im done thats really bad design and this is the 7th generation nano there is no excuse for this ridiculous designbr br second the nano comes with its own proprietary cable thats right  if you own an iphone 5 an ipad and the nano you have to haul around three different cables all priced outrageously to keep your equipment charged this is inexcusable rather than make things convenient for their customers apples greed compels them to make different cables for each item    for which they charge absurdly markedup pricesbr br third the price of the nano itself is ridiculous a 16gb mp3 player shouldnt cost 150 they charge what they can get i understand but this item should probably cost 13 of what they get for it especially with the high prices for accessories apples greed strikes againbr br bottom line  the ipods are probably the best mp3 players out there in terms of durability and sound quality if you can stomach the high prices and ignore the lack of concern for your ease of use with regards to the headphone jack and the proprietary cable then you will really like this device

2011-06-20,5.0,1,0,0,apple ipod touch 32 gb 3rd generation old model,i got my ipod used for a birthday present yes my parents got me a used ipod for my birthday how cheap and even though its used it works great the accessories that the 3g ipod touch has are limited but the ones that they do have work great i would highly recommend getting an otterbox or other hard case to protect your ipod from fallsbr what i like about the 3g is that it works and that it does what i need it to do some people like the 4g ipod touch because it has a camerai have a nice cannon digital camera and therefor i dont need a tiny ipod camerabr the difference between 4g and 3g is this a tiny digital camera my dad loves his 4g but i scratch my head over why he loves it so much the camera that it gives you provides you with such a little resolution that you cant make the photos big enough to put them onto a calendar page without them become pixelatedbr when you are deciding between 4g and 3g for your new ipod touch pick 3g its cheaper and you can spend the 100 that you didnt spend for that tiny camera on a nice digital camera ps cannons and nikons are bestbr i hope that my review will help you out

2003-01-15,1.0,1,2,5,archos 20 gb usb 20 mp3 jukeboxrecorder fm radio,i recently purchased this player  i did a lot of research and concluded that this was the best player in terms of features  well what good is a player with all the features in the world if the player does not last  i contacted tech support having to wait 30minutes only to be transferred to a voicemail  when i finally did reach them they explained to me that the player needed to be discharged and recharged several times and that my player was not faulty  well i discahrged and charged 10 times and still the player would not run longer then that  i suspect this player runs with a nimh battery  infact on thier website under thier specs the top portions statesquotlithuim ionquot and on the bottom portion it states quotnihmquot  i noticed this at first and thought that this was probably a mistake but after testing the player for a week i am sure its a nihmbr the player looks good and feels good and sounds good but highly unimpresive with its performancebr i since returned the unit and bought the nomad jukebox 3 a huge differnace  not only the player sounds better it last for about 9 hours on continuous playback  also the interface is much more professional for example i noticed when i wanted to forward to the next track on the archos it would take about 3 to five seconds to get to the next song  the nomad is instantbr bottom line the archos does not have a good and reliable battery source to run this hard drive let alone an mp3 playerbr i am sharing this review with the hope of helping someone out there make a right decision and not be fooled like mebr well donequotcreativequot
2006-02-14,4.0,1,2,2,archos gmini 400 20 gb digital audiovideo jukebox,this is a review from a 16 year old that has owned it since august 05 br im sure youve probably read other reviews and have seen the pros and cons of this item  this is truly a great item no doubt about it  to add the pros definatley outweigh the cons br  music pictures games data and video br  fast easy transfer no programs needed such as itunes br  ability to record br  displays album art sometimes br  well above average audio quality br  nice convinent play will impress your friends br  usable while charging br  decent battery life br  updates are available br  br  when recording it records the clicking sound when you press the record off button br  the back button takes you to the top level instead of just taking you back one level unless you use the parent button which is too out of reach for my comfort br  it sometimes pauses while you search for a song or whatever for the hard drive to run br  when for example you listen to music and the screen shuts off and you push a button to turn the screen back on the screen takes a few seconds to turn back on br  there are no good cases available and this is pretty fragile i dropped mine twice and have 2 dents in the metal take good care of it br  br now im guessing you are deciding wether to get this or an ipod  while ipods are nice looking and seems to hold together really well ive heard they have problems with their batteries after a while but i dont have one so i cant confirm that br all in all it depends on wether you want everything this has to offer or if youre just looking for something to listen to music on  if you just want music go ipod  they look nicer and have that nice scroll wheel for an all nice looking product  if youre planning to use all the features then get this obviously  sure it doesnt look as nice or isnt as popular and doesnt have a shiny blue bar when changing the volume but most of the time its going to be in your pocket right

2007-02-14,3.5,2,6,8,atlantic 72335185 radius 448 cd210 dvdbluraygames wood cabinet with door black with silver knob,my only complaint about this unit is that the doors are a little difficult to line up the door hinge screws are real small and the holes that you screw them into are kind of tight i used a small phillipend jewelers screw driver but i also ended up reaming the hole with a small drill bit so that the screw can go in easier i recommend a good suregrip screwdriver with a small phillip bit to do the job also when i finished assembly the doors had a tendency to scrape against the bottom of the cabinet stand i suppose that problem could have been avoided if i had lined up the doors better but what is an amateur builder to dobr overall i am satisfied with the unit despite some minor construction flaws that could have been avoided with better tools and a better builder the unit is very attractive looking as i prefer the media storage units with doors rather than the open racks i highly recommend anchoring the unit to the wall for safety reasons when the unit is full of dvds andor cds it can tip over very easilydoes take up alot of space would have liked it taller and less wide

2012-06-18,5.0,1,2,2,bose ae2 aroundear audio headphones,comfort  i have a confession to make  as much of an audio snob as i try to be it really was the comfort and sleek lightweight design of the bose ae2 headphones that encouraged me to pick them up after much contemplation  these headphones are extremely comfortable and about as light as a quality headphone set could possibly bebr br quality  as for the sound quality lets be clear on a few things  first this is not the noisecancelling bose set that retails about 29999  ive tried those out at best buy and the noisecancelling effect is quite amazing  but thats a bit out of my price range to justify something that really only has value to me the 2 or 3 times i fly on a plane per yearbr br also a lot of people rated this at 4 stars or even less which is pretty surprising to me  i think theres a lot of antibose sentiment due to the price and the snob factor among other reasons  to me this is a 5star headphone set  for all intents and purposes this is boses entry level set except that bose doesnt put disposable garbage on the market  they have a reputation for high quality  target has these things on displays all across the country  go there and try it out for yourselfbr br the bass  from reading the other reviews both positive and negative a common point of contention with bose is the bass  with bose its not so much about a particular sound trait powerful bass etc as it is about clarity  the sound profile has a wide range from bass to treble and it handles virtually all ranges with out overdrive or distortion  but the bass on the ae2 is not weak by any means  if you dont believe try them out with some type of electronic or r  b music with low bass drum machines  people seem to think that powerful bass is the only way to evaluate headphones and thats just wrong  yes your set needs to be able to handle bass but the difference between this and the 50 pair of sony extra bass headphones is that the bass notes will not overpower the remaining frequencies on the bose ae2  maybe you like to have everything drowned out by bass notes and thats fine but if you want more precise sound while still being powerful id go with the ae2br br yes youre paying a premium for the bose name but if you like the sound and the comfort i dont think 125 to 150 is unreasonable for a pair of headphones i hope to use for many many yearsat the bass notes will not overpower the remaining frequencies on the bose ae2  maybe you like to have everything drowned out by bass notes and thats fine but if you want more precise sound while still being powerful id go with the ae2br br yes youre paying a premium for the bose name but if you like the sound and the comfort i dont think 125 to 150 is unreasonable for a pair of headphones i hope to use for many many years

2013-11-17,5.0,1,1,1,bose quietcomfort 20 headphones,not only are these comfortable enough for the full duration of a 14 hour flight but the noise cancelling is incredible on one leg i sat in the window seat next to the engine of a 777 and with these on it was basically silent that means you dont have to turn up the sound as loud to be comfortable which makes it much easier for me to wear them for an extended duration  with my old inear headphones i would have to 34drown out34 the noisebr br that said theyre probably not as comfortable as my shure inear headphones so i dont wear them around home or in other quiet situations but for an airplane or public transit these headphones are incredible and well worth the cost

2015-04-27,3.0,1,2,2,bose soundlink mini bluetooth speaker,first of all the hoopla for this speaker completely got me people rave and rave about how amazing it is i thought 34wow this has to be some one of a kind artisanal speaker34 it was all very deceivingbr br i love bose i always have bose tends to have a great overall sound clean crisp loud deep base the soundlink has all these great qualities until you raise the volume to its max level i upgraded to the soundlink from a jbl flip which i totally loved i felt i was due for an 34upgrade34 and did a tiny bit of research mistake and felt this one would do it for me truth be told i was super disappointed within 10 minutes of turning it on with full charge  i love bass love it the jbl gives a much crisper overall sound without ever distorting so i assumed the sl would blow the flip out of the water and it just plain didnt song after song it distorted pretty heavily at high volume mudding the sound completely while i think this speaker is great to have in a small room because it does sound great at a mid volume level i still prefer my jbl it just didnt live up to its portable 34outdoor34 friendly sound and not at all to these crazy reviews for 200 it should deliver a much better sound than a speaker for half its price i am considering returning it and searching for another bluetooth speaker instead if i decide to keep this one i will most likely just use it around the house and will definitely keep using my flip for louderon the go purposes insteadbr br i suggest you test the sound out in person

2014-06-09,5.0,1,6,8,brainwavz m5 in ear earbuds noise isolating earphones stereo headphones,note i received a free product in exchange for an honest reviewbr br i have many different pairs of headphonesearbuds as im constantly search for one that i really like  although i generally use the same set of headphones while i am traveling my sweet asinb0054jj0qw bose quietcomfort 15 acoustic noise cancelling headphones i rarely use them around the house as i cant hear anything else when they are on which admittedly also cancels out the background kid noise and they are a little cumbersome to drag out whenever i want to quickly listen to some music  i also dont bring them to work so i need something to listen to music or a training video when im at my desk so im routinely digging through my stack of headphones  i have been using a set of asinb000092yr6 sony mdrj10 headphones with nonslip design black which i really like because they give good overall audio range playback and are comfortable on my ear  i typically do not like buying earbuds because the onesizefitsall manufacturing is rarely a size that fits me  the earbuds are either too big or too little or sound like crap or have a cord thats too short or whateverbr br because of my prejudice towards earbuds i was somewhat skeptical when i received the brainwavz m5 in ear noise isolating earphones  eventhough i also own brainwavzs r3 and s1 earbuds like i said i constantly looking for something that i really like  when the product arrived i was pleasantly pleased at all the items that were in the product packaging  included in the box were not only the m5 headphones but also you get eight different earbud tips and a red and black zippered hardshell case 3 12 x 3 x 1 34 which holds the headphones and all the attachmentsbr br because i generally find that earbuds dont fit my ears very well i was literally overjoyed at all the different types and sizes of tips  with the eight tips including the one thats shipped on the headphones you get pairs of small medium and large silicone tips a biflange tip and specially designed memory foam tips  with this assortment anyone should be able to find the pair of tips that works the best with your ears  although the packaging really talked up the memory foam tips i found them hard to attach to the headphones and somewhat cumbersome to use  instead i found that the biflange tips worked best for me and i could adjust the volume a bit by pushing them a little deeper into my ear or pulling them out a little  overall it was very easy to change the tips once i figured out how to do it so its somewhat hard for me to understand why other reviewers are saying that it is difficult to dobr br the hard case is also a really nice addition  eventhough the rubbery spaghetti cords of the m5 resist the usual tangling of the thin round cords i really liked that brainwavz included this case to hold not only the headphones but also all the tips as this is part of the reason i like the bose quietcomfort headphones  because of its compact size and hard shell i can throw it into my briefcase backpack or suitcase and not worry about the headphones rolling around getting broken or tangled or having trouble finding them  finally it may sound trite but i also liked the packaging  the box does a really great job of explaining all the product features looks good and the english is translated very well from chinese as opposed to other overseas companies that ive worked withbr br the audio quality once i found the tips that worked the best for me was superior to the standard 2540 earbuds that you typically see in the electronics aisle of audio or big box stores  im obviously an audio file and customarily throw out or give to the kids any headphones that i think have a crappy sound  i compared the m5 headphones to many of my headphones and earbuds and although they obviously couldnt compare to my bose the m5 does pack a pretty big sound into a small package  much better than the asinb003tqahy6 apple headset apple earphones with remote and mic which i consider to be on the very good side and other earbuds ive owned in this price range  although the sound quality and overall range was inferior to both the brainwavz r3 and s1 earbuds these products are twice as expensive and five times as expensive as m5 headphones so you should expect a difference in performance  the spaghetti cords took a little getting used to as ive never had anything like them  their resistance to tangling was a huge plus and i liked the length almost 5 ft long as my experience with earbuds is that they are typically too shortbr br overall the m5 headphones are superior in quality manufacturing and sound production  for the price just under 35 im not sure you will be able to find anything betteres pack a pretty big sound into a small package  much better than the asinb003tqahy6 apple headset apple earphones with remote and mic which i

2010-03-16,1.0,1,4,4,c2g 900mhz wireless headphones 41313,if you have a tv setup with hdmi cables and you get this device to work please respond below  my ignorance could be why this product is failing but i have tried everything and to no avail      i purchased these headphones so that i could stay up late at night and not disturb any neighbors  i live in an apartment where the walls are razor thin so thin that you can hear everything your neighbor downstairs is doing like conversations and getting food out of the fridge    anyway i read the reviews and figured to give this a try     yes they do work  i tried them with my ipod and iphone  so far so good      the problem is the tvhome theatreps3 connection  i have hdmi cables for everything and so far it cant pick up a signal anywhere  the only way to pick up a signal is to jack up your volume nearat maximum on the ipod and iphone to get a red power light in front once you have charged the batteries 24 hours    well the whole point of getting the headphones is so that i wouldnt disturb my neighbors and somehow the only way to remotely connect to the television is to blast the sound loud and long enough to upset my neighbors  i have to use the redwhite audio connectors provided because my hdtv doesnt have a headphone jack  i showed one of them what i was trying and we sat there and waited nearly a minute before it finally connected  its just not worth doing when i stay up late at night      thats not even close to good enough  unless someone convinces me otherwise these headphones are just downright pointless for people like me     i would just suggest getting long wired headphones if available

2013-12-21,3.0,1,0,0,crosley cr249 bk keepsake usb turntable black discontinued by manufacturer,i dont know a whole lot about the mechanics of a turntable so i cant say what exactly is wrong with mine i got it for my birthday last october from my dad when he gave me a ton of his old records the built in speakers are really terrible they have a very tinny sound and i had to hook it up to my stereo system to make it bearable once i did this i didnt have any complaints about the sound quality it did seem a little off too slow maybe when i listen to 45s but not enough so that its a problembr br until now ive had it for a little over a year but i didnt try out the usb until this month i thought i would record all my dads vinyls as a christmas gift to him and it worked great for a few days of pretty heavy duty use however last night i noticed the instrumental part of the music was playing back pretty poorly it sounded warbly and somewhat tinny the way the speakers sounded originally but this is playing through my computer speakers which are great i dont know what is causing this but now everything that im recording sounds awful and im embarrassed to give my dad all of his favorite music from high school with quality like this im super bummed the quality is bad playing through my speakers as wellbr br honestly you could probably find something better for the price of this turntable and the speakers which are pretty much necessary because the ones built in are just awful to listen to this machine is nothing to write home about

2012-01-19,5.0,1,3,3,cyberpower pfc compatible pure sine wave tower ups,i built a gaming computer for my son with an active pfc power supply  these require sine wave battery backup units to work properly in the event of a power outage  after extensive research it became apparent that this feature is usually only found on very expensive units  i also have both mac and windows computers in my house and wanted the flexibility to repurpose the unit in the future if necessaryon macs a hid compatible usb port is necessary to allow proper function  this narrowed my product search down considerablymany high end sinewave units dont have hid compliant ports and are incompatible with macs  finally i wanted a unit with avr the most common of the features mentioned  this unit was unique in that it met all of these requirements at a reasonable price  the led display is a nice feature since i can monitor power consumption in watts and input voltage  downsides  the unit is on the small side and so i doubt that runtime although adequate will be overly impressive  the software is pretty bare bonesit would be nice to have a more extensive feature set on the software such as email capability when on backup power etc  overall 5 stars

2007-01-19,5.0,1,6,7,etymotic research er4pt micropro noiseisolating inear earphones black discontinued by manufacturer,superb headphones these er4ps  beautiful sound isolation and a perfectly balanced tone and sound quality that provides depth and clarity i owned the shure e2c headphones prior to these actually i still own them  problem is the rubber over the wire has split and the actual wires are open to the elements so i thought ill keep those and use them at the gym and get myself a new even nicer pair of cans  problem with the shures is that the wire flexes and fatigues at the same point due to the bending of it behing the ear and then combine that with the terrible case where you wrap the phones which causes even more stress and its no wonder the rubber covering the wiring eventually gave out  as thick as they were  br  br well on to these etys  they are awesome the shures sounded good  but these etys seem to have quite a bit more dynamic range  the shures sounded excellent after using standard ipod or sony headphones but now these headphones are making the shures sound a little flat and lacking in the treble and mid end the bass is excellent and just the right amount when the eq of your machine is kept flat and the headphones have a superb balance as  far as tonality br  br subtle details are even easier to hear with these than with the e2s overall the sound quality of these things is superb and so is the noise isolation in fact  these seem to cancel out more noise than the e2s which i thought were excellent but these are truly better also a very important point is that these headphones are comfortable the e2s were good with the foam tips but man oh man was the flange tip uncomfortable it was actually capable of scarring your ear they were hard and uncomfortable so you can imagine what a pleasant surprise it was to find that the soft triple flanged tips are very comfortable with the etys as are the foam tips they also block out a lot of external noise the only issue i have is that indeed the cables do cause a microphone effectbut the supplies clip is quite useful for keeping the cords from danling much  the e2s were less prone to this mic effect but they also didnt seal as well as these etys  especially with the flange tips overall  these are brilliant headphones and at a price that is now much more affordable than the 300 they are supposed to retail for they are superb value for money too do yourself a favor and pick up a pair of these  you will not be dissapointed  your music will literally come alive and you will appreciate the comfortable isolation these headphones provide lastly the presentation is also superb you get a box with all the accesories a carrying case extra foam and flange tips etc all in all these are the best headphones you can buy in the under 300 category

2012-07-13,5.0,1,0,0,jbuds j2 premium hifi noise isolating earbuds style headphones onyx black discontinued by manufacturer,i bought these headphones to wear around the house and other places when i do not intend to use my shure 215s i also bought these for the passenger to wear on my bike while riding these headphones work great for my intentions i have not used them on my motorcycle yet only because i use my shure 215s for noisecancelling which work quite well i have read several reviews on these headphones and i am impressed at a lot of them many are far more technical than i would ever wish to get i am just writing to state that i do enjoy these headphones for typical listening to my music be it the doors or johnny cash for 1500 you really cant go wrong
2008-12-06,5.0,1,0,1,jbuds j2 premium hifi noiseisolating earbuds style headphones,i got my blue buds wednesday and i am more than impressed with performance just like charlie i tore into my package as if i was trying to win the golden ticket because i was so excited to put them on after reading all the good reviews on here more on the packaging in a bit my first song i jammed out to was pink floyd  another brick in the wall pt2 because the song has all kinds of stuff going on with it ie bass rhythm highs lows and everything in between i was a bit worried because some folks had mentioned the buds sounding muddied and i knew if that was true i was going to find out real quick all i can say to those people now is clean out the wax in your ears these buds by far and away blew out those poc headphones apple gives you with the ipod touch i also read in one of these reviews that music sounded bad at the 1000 mhz level i really think if your crazy enough to know your mozart sounds bad at that particular level no set of headphones is going to make you happy i bought these buds because like everyone else right now i just dont have a ben or two to throw down on some buds these are my first pair of sound isolating buds so all i can tell anyone is how these work i wore them in downtown boise on a lunch stroll and i could not hear any traffic noises at all just my tunes i also work in a very noisy office environment and when i had the buds in i couldnt hear any of my coworkers constant yapping so imho the sound isolation works well enough that it will exceed most peoples expectations i bet there are better options out there for the people who need complete silence but again these are only 25 i also need to mention that these buds are so comfortable to wear i have had them in for 2 hours at a time and there was no discomfort at all as others have mentioned there is nothing flimsy about these buds and you can tell they were made to last my only complaint about my purchase has nothing to do with the buds themselves but about the packaging they came in listen up jlabs there is no need to package a product that takes a chainsaw to get into i just about cut off three of my fingers to get into the dumb package for all those getting these buds make sure you have a real sharp knife and keep your fingers out of the way while attempting to break into jlabs bomb proof packaging in conclusion these buds are right on the money for us consumers who are looking for a quality awesomesounding lowcost option to replace those crappy headphones we get with our mp3s anyone who is buying a mp3 for a gift this year ought to do the recipient a favor and pick up a pair of these buds as well

2009-07-28,1.0,1,2,3,jabra c820s active noise cancelling stereo headphones,i bought these about 7 months ago because the reviews were generally good and theyre much more affordable than bose or sennheiser  i work in a cubicle and i leave my headphones there so they are truly babied and yet this product just deteriorates ill explain    about two weeks after i bought them the noise canceling feature broke and when it breaks it gives you a hint of static and then it sounds like a gunshot in your ear  you can only contact customer service via an online form i always find it incredibly inconsiderate when companies dont list a phone number when im angry i want to tell someone  from there customer service is mediocre but sufficient  they make you pay the shipping to their repair department but they pay  it on the way back and they just replaced my headphones with a new set      the reason i am just writing now about 6 months later is because the structure of the headphones just cracks and wears these were built to be nice for a few weeks a couple months maybe but after a few months that band just splits  after it split i lost audio in the right speaker  i cant emphasize enough how pampered these headphones are they literally travel no farther than from my desk to my head everyday    if you buy these im confident youll be happy for at least a couple weeks but if youre looking to have noise canceling headphones for a few months or years youll save money by spending the extra 150 now on a company that cares about quality

2010-03-16,5.0,1,0,0,klipsch image s4 ear enhanced bass noiseisolating headphones,i bought klipsch s4 headphones for use with my new zune hd  they are the first inear headphones i have owned  i find them better than the overtheear variety i have employed in the past for noise canceling and cell phone use  they are more of a pain to get registered so that the sound image has that elusive centeredness but give a far better sound and better noiseblocking my wife complains that she has difficulty attracting my attention  i havent used them in a plane yet  i have seen comments about the s4 that claim poor performance  i noticed that mine sounded flat and tinny at first but i ran them overnight on orchestral music which is what i listen to and their performance improved enormously  this procedure is described and recommended in several reviews of these headphones  thanks to the knowledgeable reviewers  i would not hesitate to recommend these headphones
2012-02-07,5.0,1,0,0,klipsch image s4 ear enhanced bass noiseisolating headphones,great sound have always had problems with other buds falling out on my right ear even with a larger cup on the right  ear the soft oval cups fit perfectlywont come out even while running or doing excersize
2012-06-14,3.0,1,0,0,klipsch image s4 ear enhanced bass noiseisolating headphones,these headphones have great sound and the silicone tips fit perfectly in my ears they were extremely comfortable and i was able to leave them in my ears for hours without having to take them out unlike other earphones ive used they also have a great bass but the high ranges are not as clear these arent exactly noiseisolating as the company claims they only isolate noise because you are putting them fairly far into your earbr br unfortunately on the 3rd day after buying these one of the silicone tips broke off in addition the sound suddenly became distorted and weak while i was sitting at my desk motionless because i had read reviews saying that these headphones are delicate i kept them in the little silver case when not in use so it was extremely disappointing when they broke out of nowhere while i wasnt even doing anythingbr br i do like these enough that i plan to order a new pair if you dont mind the risk i would highly recommend these headphones
2012-12-13,2.0,1,0,0,klipsch image s4 ear enhanced bass noiseisolating headphones,i bought these headphones after my old bose headphones broke i decided i would try a different brand and see if they could offer the same sound quality with perhaps a more durable build after researching and reading reviews i was pretty sold on these buds the first thing i noticed when i put them on was how good they were at noise canceling the i put my regular music on and the sound was just awful the bass is not rich and the highs are screechy i felt like i was listening to my music coming through a tin can the detail of the music i had learn to love was completely lost and i could not listen to them for more than thirty minutes i tried 34breaking34 them in by playing music for hours and seeing if the sound would change but there was absolutely no difference another very annoying thing about these guys is that if the cable so much as moves you can hear it so if you walk or move with them on you can automatically hear a very annoying swish noise from the cablesbr the sound is just plain awful invest a bit more and get something like the bose in ear headphones or another product with better sound quality if you feel like buying these you might as well use the cheap headphones that come with your device
2013-03-02,5.0,1,0,0,klipsch image s4 ear enhanced bass noiseisolating headphones,at first i was not satisfied with my order within minutes of leaving my three star review the company called me and told me that they would like to send me a new pair of the ear buds that i had ordered this is a great company if your thinking about doing business with someone else dont play it safe and go with these guys a

2014-12-03,5.0,1,4,4,logitech 915000225 harmony smart keyboard for living room control of 8 devices and streaming entertainment,ive had a tough experience with this keyboard but as with my previous experience with logitech support concerning problems with my harmony one remote all has come out wellbr br everything was quick and simple to setup especially since it imported my harmony one settings  but the app didnt have an option for adding a usb receiver control for my home theater pc neither of the 2 that come with this remote  after several days of working with the support folks i was asked to put the hub in pair mode and then plug in a receiver  previous attempts to resetpair was with the usb receiver already in place  for some reason this didnt work the first time but did the second and now i have full control of my tv dish hopper onkyo receiver bluray roku and htpc on my table next to my seat  no more pointing and holding the remote until all the actions take place  it takes some getting used to having to look down and press a control rather than by feel as it would be with my one remote but not having to aim at the tv area is a huge plus  and i can still use my other remotes if i need tobr br as others have mentioned there are some things in the app that could be improved but i was never stymied by them common sense things  but i did have one annoyance  the fast forward ff and skip forward sf are assigned to one button with ff being a quick press and sf being a long press same for back  since i rarely use ff and cant imagine why anyone would i prefer that sf be quick press  this way each time i tap the button i get a 30 second advance  long press is way to slow  i want to reverse this setup  the only way to fix this was to delete ff and then assign sf to quick press works great  i would then have liked to have assigned ff to long press but long press is not an option apparently its only available to the logitech people so now my ff is a 2 key combination not a good solutionbr br all in all im loving this remote and kudos to the tech support team im confident that improvements will come so its a high 5

2009-04-11,3.0,1,1,1,logitech harmony 880 advanced universal remote control discontinued by manufacturer,i had high hopes for this remote to empty the basket of remotes next to the media center  now its just one of the 8 remotes in there    pros   seems to work with most devices  of course my ps3 and wii it does not   appearance   feel in the hand is great   nice charging stand if you have the shelf space  my directtv control uses two aa that last a year  i think id rather have the shelf space back   has the ability to setup multiple devices with one button push  the neat thing about this is that not only does it power the device on but switches the receiver to the proper input setting etc    cons   layout is horrible  the buttons you use the most play stop forward etc are under the palm of your hand when you hold the device  what were they thinking  you literally have to hold the remote in your finger tips to get at the buttons   charger  my directtv control uses two aa that last a year  i think id rather have the shelf space back  yes the charger is a positive and a negative feature   the screen seems like a good idea but not so much  the pictures of this device always show pretty color pictures  well thats only on the main menu when the pictures make it hard to read the text  every device menu is several screens of plain text  you have to page through the text looking for the right control  for example power off is usually on page 3  how weird is that   extremely labor intensive to configure   configuration is tied to their web site  thats horrible   nobody in the house will use this remote but me because its just easier to use the original remotes   power cycling is flawed  the media room devices are left in various powered on states by other family members  the remote has only the option to toggle the power for devices it needs to turn on or off  it makes this decision by what the remote remembers was done last  therefore it turns devices off that should be on and vice versa
2009-12-23,3.0,1,2,2,logitech harmony 900 rechargeable remote with color touch screen discontinued by manufacturer,i hate to repeat what so many others have said before me so i wont i use harmony remotes model 890 every day  they control ever piece of home theater in my house  ive had the 890 pretty much since it came out way back when  i simply expected this new 900 model to be the new improved version with its sleek new touch screen and cool buttons  in a way it is  the new 900 has a great new touchscreen and a new button layout  also new to the 900 are color buttons  as many devices use red yellow green and blue buttons as shortcuts the new 900 has added these buttons to the remotes hard button lineup  the charging cradle works better with the addition of bigger contacts there is no more need to wiggle the remote around in the cradle to get a good contact as with some of the older 890sbr br while thats all fine and good and exciting this is an rf remote after all made for people like me whos tv isnt exactly in the same place as the rest of the home theater componants youd expect the range to be sufficent to reach every corner of an average house  thats not the case with the 900  the range on this remote is about half of what i expected it to be  depending upon the number of obstacles in the way it will transmit 2540 feet max  when youre tv is 50 away from most of youre home theater setup this poses a considerable problem  im told by logitech that this is being looked into and there is hope of a fix for his problem  if you use z wave or at least know what that is ive read several complaints from people stating that thier z wave devices are no longer supported by the 900  while its true that logitech no longer supports z wave devices according to some insiders at logitech the remote still does  wile logitech will not provide any product support for connecting z wave devices with the 900 the 900 still has the same capability as the 890 did with regard to controlling these devices  if you search the devices menu chances are youll find the the same z wave devices you used with your 890  all in all the 900 is a sleek great looking ergonomic rf remote control that just falls short of 4 stars  at least until the range is impovedfind the the same z wave devices you used with your 890  all in all the 900 is a sleek great looking ergonomic rf remote control that just falls short of 4 stars  at least until the range is impoved

2011-11-15,4.0,1,2,2,maha powerex wizard one mhc9000 advanced battery charger and analyzer  deluxe accessory storage case included,ill start by saying this might be the best battery charger ever as it charges discharges refreshes and breaks in a variety of aa  aaa rechargeable batteries exceptionally well but now some criticisms  1 user interface is overbright  this product is obnoxious to use overnight if located anywhere near or in a bedroom  2 the first one delivered had a small program bug  manufacturer replaced quickly and free of charge including shipping  3 the user interface cycles between slots too slowly and doesnt provide much time for initial entry before applying default settings  next generation should in my opinion provide users all the time they need for initial entry  it should also not cycle through slots but instead be dark unless a battery has just been put in or unless information is requested for a given slot  this would clear up all the issues i have with this product  this is my favorite charger but i dont think there is yet a 5star charger on the market

2011-02-22,5.0,1,0,0,manhattan 177337 hdmi splitter 2port,i never realized how easy it could be to power 2 tvs from one cable box  just plug the line out of the cable box into this unit  then just run hdmi cables to your two hdtvs  unlike the old days with nonhdtv hdmi splitters have to amplify the signal in order to power two hdtvs  thats why you need a splitter like this one rather than just the passive small metal splitters that sufficed for old tvs    the picture looks sharp on the samsung 46 inch right next to this splitter as well as the toshiba 40 inch hdtv one floor down and 30 feet of hdmi cable away  looking at the pictures this unit appears identical to the generic 12 splitter that is more popular here on amazon  i bought mine at an elecronics store as their only 12 splitter in stock  of course both tvs are going to be getting the same cable channel and you can only change the channel from the location where the cable box is located  this actually worked too well  now i want to add one more hdtv  in the kitchen  so that means this nice unit is going back as long as the 14 digital splitter jtech digital 4 port hdmi power splitter for full hd 1080p i just ordered works just as well to power my two existing hdtvs as well as the third hdtv i just ordered for the kitchen

2007-03-11,4.0,1,0,0,motorola signal booster 48409500100 bidirectional rf amplifier discontinued by manufacturer,i had a 10db radio shack two way signal booster that the motorola replaced im prepping for my hdtv that will arrive next week the moto is rated to 15db i found the signal from my comcast cable box was low 9db for some channels 0 for others i figured a 5db boost would help do the trick without overboosting which can cause signal degredation overboost can make the image worsebr br after installing the moto the signal only increased by 1db from 9 to 8 a whopping 1db difference between the 15db motorola versus 10db radio shack im not sure what happened to the 5dbs it was supposed to be over the 10db radio shack job the good news the moto booster did improve signal quality over the radio shack potentially from the newer cables or the booster itself the problem for me is to many splits i have only a single cable coming to my house that runs into a comcast provided 8 way splitter imagine 57db loss per split then one split going to the first floor i have a 3 way splitter to cable box vcr and dvr on second floor another split i have a 4 way splitter which handles cable box dvr and slingbox i know where six of the eight splits from the comcast external box go but the other two are a mystery in my house hence why i need extra juice coming in and comcast refuses to boost me since the single cable coming to the house has good signal mind you it splits eight ways and then individuals splitters through the house at some point i plan on pulling the single comcast inside to my own box which has a power amplified 8 way that i can managebr br tip for comcast cable box users hold the  pause button on your remote until the email light comes on then press the page up button on the remote and it will say please wait this will gain you access to see the signal strength screen you can then flip through the channels using the numeric buttons or changel  to see the differences in signal strength between channels usually the badchannels you noticed before have weak signals pressing the page up will flip through other comcast screens that wont make sense press the exit button on the remote to leave the service mode

2015-06-24,5.0,1,3,3,mpow boombag portable waterresistant wireless bluetooth 40 speaker,in a nutshell awesome  for starters i didnt realize how small it was  see my photo  its tiny  literally fits in the palm of your hand  it also comes with a tiny carabiner clip which is actually useful because the speaker is designed to hang in the air like off a belt loop  it sounds noticeably better hanging in the open air vs sitting on a flat surface so if you can clip it on something to hang  get some air to breath the sound gets even better  second the sound not only surprisingly excellent but loud too  and theres even some bass i was shocked  i did not expect this for thirty bucks  i listened to a few of the other brands of display models at best buy  was extremely disappointed especially since a lot of them cost 149  this beats out every single one i listened to  if youve ever heard the little bose 51 cubes that cost a couple grand it basically sounds like that  nice  clear with a solid almost midbass woofer not tinny like a lot of the other mini speakers ive heard which also lack the punch to even the sound out  i also have an axess spbt1031rd bluetooth tube speaker which is a great deal bigger about the size of a roll of paper towels and it sounds like garbage compared to this thing  the mpow is 1 extremely clear compared to other portable speakers 2 has enough of a bass thump to sound wellrounded and 3 somehow has roomfilling sound despite the tiny size  it sounds better than my cheap computer speakers by a long shot  i mean its still a small speaker  has its limitations but i am more than happy for both the price  size  couldnt recommend it enough best budget tech purchase ive made in a long time  i did test out it out as a speakerphone a couple times  it was just okay nothing special  you still need to be close to it or talk loud for people to hear you  also it has a minijack input so if you get a headphone cable you can use it as a wired speaker if you dont want to use bluetoothlike for a computer speaker or something

2015-04-25,4.0,1,1,1,neojdx wingz wireless bluetooth sports earbuds earphones  wireless sports headphones running gym parkour exercise inear headphones  sweatproof  rainproof,042915 update for apple watch i thought the issue i had that i mentioned below would be resolved by doing what the manufacturer suggests but when i went on my first run with my apple watch and these headphones i still experienced a lot of issues with the headphones cutting out i wear my watch on my left hand and the receiver for the headphones is in my right ear i think the issue here is that the bluetooth for the apple watch isnt strong enough because when i moved the watch to my right hand the issue of the sound cutting out stopped if i moved my right hand and placed it against my back it would start cutting out and if i put my hand over my watch it would start cutting out as well so i would tend to place the blame on the apple watch in this instance and think that the signal power for the bluetooth is pretty low i can live with wearing it on my right wrist when i travel or go running to solve the problem the earphones stayed in my ears with no issues during the run which was great so all in all im still happy with the earphones themselves  original review  starts out bad but gets better my first pair of bluetooth headphones so i wasnt sure what to expect i mainly wanted them for running and airplane travel because i was tired of messing with the cords i read a lot of reviews and settled on these and just took them out for a trial run i liked that i could pair it with both my iphone and apple watch and tried it with my iphone first it kept cutting out even though my phone was in my pocket and it was pretty annoying but it seemed to stabilize after a bit but was still doing it then i tried it with my watch i wear my watch on my left wrist and the bluetooth receiver for the headset was in my right ear it cut out much worse and was even more annoying when i had my arm down to my side it would almost cut out completely and i figured there was no way these would work for me running  the sound was acceptable it isnt what youll get out of a wired set of earphones but it has a fairly decent range and good sound quality for what you pay despite this i got back home and was going to return them because i couldnt stand them constantly cutting out i then went to the manufacturers website to check the range which was listed as up to 30 feet then i checked the support page and the first item there was the headphones cutting out it suggests to clear all of the paired bluetooth devices in your phone by selecting 34forget this device34 and then repairing the headphones  i did this and the problem was solved i was able to walk around my house with my phone in another room and it didnt cut out did the same with my watch and it was fine as well  the fit is good and they give you multiple stabilizers and plug sizes they feel good on my ears almost like there is nothing there which is good the sound could be better but if you want better sound then i think you need to spend an extra 100 or so for a higher end pair these work perfectly for what i need

2008-02-22,4.5,2,3,3,parent asin for etymotic research er6i,these inear earphones were given to me as a birthday gift from my lovely girlfriend i may not have the wallet for audiophile equipment but i consider my ears sharp enough to appreciate nuances in sound     product used on 80gb ipod classic while i typically use grado sr60s as a baseline for frequency response and reference monitoring    first let me address some hesitations i had before receiving these earphones    1 the inear fit    i found the apple stock earbuds to fit comfortably and snugly in my ears i have small ear canals and i was worried that the smallest supplied eartips would be too big for my ears i use the dualflanged eartips smaller than the tripleflanged eartips shown as the product photographand they fit like a gem follow etymotics suggestion regarding wetting the eartips for easier insertion the seal created is amazing i constantly snap my fingers in front of the inserted er6is shocked by how well they isolate the supplied foam eartips are very comfortable as well but they do take a few more seconds to expand into an adequate seal    2 bass frequency response  i listen to everything and i mean it i had to first test these inears by listening to bodysnatchers off radioheads in rainbows i can hear every instrument clearly in the mix its balanced i can hear a nicely rounded and punchy kick drum the distortion is distorted without clipping the er6i drivers are powerful and they have not yet rattled when pushed to higher decibels listen to punchup at a wedding and you can hear the thump of the 808 without the honking of the stupid mbta trains on bus campus or the sounds of range rovers unnecessarily revving by you my guilty pleasure is hiphop today i heard r kellys step in the name of love my goodness my head could not stop nodding the high end is articulate without overpowering the lows and the mids while the bass is well balanced and powerful im also a bassist and ive used these as inear monitorsand they accurately represent my bass tones and low end and moderate volumes theres no need to push them so high because of the superb isolation    3 cord thickness  theyre thinner than standard ipod earbuds but theres no sense of fragility i wrap them around my ipod and toss them in my jacket ive read reviews where people have yanked the earbuds by the wire i have not done this because there is enough room for me to get a firm grip on the earbuds and remove them securely with ease     4 maintenance  for optimal results keep your ears clean and the eartips cleaner the er6is are equipped with 2 replacement filters i cant comment on the frequency of replacement as my earphones currently sound like gold and have maintained that tonal integrity since theyve been plugged into my ipod    pros supreme isolation fantastic frequency response listening versatility included accessories    cons i dont have enough new music to listen toive had my er6is for about a month now and am well pleased with them  once properly inserted the sound quality is excellent and outside noises are blocked almost completely  great for air travel working out in a noisy gym etc but a bad idea if you need to hear a little bit of whats going on around you like cars buses someone trying to talk to you etc  as others have noted the cord is quite thin so prone to entanglement and just a bit long  the selection of earplug sizes made it easy to find just the right size  in the right soundblocking application these are great earphones
2008-04-05,1.0,1,0,3,parent asin for etymotic research er6i,after reading other reviews for the etymotic er6i i purchased it for use on long overseas airline flights before my last trip i tested the new ear buds with my ipod nano i was shocked with the poor quality of the sound the sound reminded me of the very tinny sounds from a 1910 home built wire crystal radio i tried each of the removable ear pieces with no improvement obviously i wasted the cost of these ear buds and i have returned to using the apple ear buds that came with my nano

2013-07-29,5.0,1,0,1,panasonic ergofit inear earbud headphone,i used them once very briefly and loved them then i left them in pants my girlfriend washed them and they still work very well
2013-11-04,3.5,2,0,0,panasonic ergofit inear earbud headphone,sounds great i actually used a different pair of rubber which allow for a tighter seal in my ear great bass and clarity especially pricei see people said some pretty good things about them but i found the sound to be equivalent to the regular apple headphones actually worse than that they were pretty uncomftorable to wear in my ears also with edged plastic meh
2014-06-27,4.2,5,8,11,panasonic ergofit inear earbud headphone,these only lasted 3 weeks and went completely deadi will not ever purchase them againthis might be the best bang for buck purchase ive ever made on amazon outstanding quality full bass great for working out  doesnt fall out when sweatingwetand even better pricepointi was looking for a cheap set of earbuds that worked well my cousin recommended me these for their durability and sound i was surprised at how good these are they have excellent sound and handle bass amazingly i would certainly recommend this to anyone also these were really affordable got them in 2 days so i was surprisedsimple but brilliant engineering  these are basic earbuds that happen to sound awesome by the way but theyve put a cap on them with an extension that goes into your ear canal a bit  there is a cushion that goes over that tube extension and they provide three different sizes which seals out the outside noise and holds the bud nicely into your ear  the way this is made and the way it gets positioned into your ear makes it impossible for sweat to get into and on the actual speaker membrane thus shorting it out i finally have a great solution for running headphones  and believe me these sound great  i used to own a pair of eymotic er6 head phone and those were really amazing yes  but they cost in the 150 range and had filters that had to be changed periodically  and quite frankly the bass was a little thin on some songs  these headphones have rich bass  i noticed that some people complain about the bass but there is a quick solution if your bass is too much go to your eq on your phone and select bass reducer and youll probably find the right balance  as far as im concerned these are the best find of the year for methis headphone is comfortable and sounds great  i love the design with the rubber piece on the sidefits nicely  wish it had a volume controlcant knock it when its not in the description  great ear piece especially for the price

2015-08-18,4.0,3,0,0,panasonic ergofit inear earbud headphone,i bought these to replace the original verizon headphones that came with my droid turbo awesome cell phone unfortunately i washed them in the washing machine and for awhile i thought they were unaffected i actually loved the sound of these factory headsets unfortunately i eventually discovered the cause of their creeping inferior reproduction the left earphone after a good spin cycle of detergent and sloshing had diminished at least 50 they had been exceptional but no more im 66 i know great sound i wear a pair of over ear senheisers as my regular headphones on my daily bike ride all i wanted for my everyday buds was 34decent34 these babies surpassed decent for the price no doubt about it believe the great reviews this is one of them price vs qualitya rare findnoting impressive on sound but build to lastwas great when they was working but they didnt last long about four months tops

2014-02-06,4.0,1,0,0,panasonic noise canceling headphones,they are great headphones but like all headphones they can squeeze your ears after a while also the noise canceling does nothing except sometimes increase the headphones volume however dont let that discourage you because they still block out a lot of sound with out the noise canceling function on good buy worth my money but needs a mic
2013-05-22,4.0,1,0,0,panasonic overtheear stereo headphones rpht227 black  silver integrated volume controller travelfold design,while these headphones are kind of uncomfortable due to the size of the ear pads small they do work perfectly the sound is good the cord is a good length and the headphones are adjustable enough to fit anybody they do not block outside sound but i have no problem with that there is a volume adjuster on the cord overall especially for the low price they are a good pair of headphones
2007-01-09,5.0,1,3,3,panasonic portable cd  mp3 player,this player has been bouncing around in our minivan for over a year now plays music skipfree ive had three similar cd players now theyve all worked pretty well but this one slightly outperforms the others and had a great price
2008-08-02,4.0,1,5,5,panasonic rpbt10 bluetooth headphones,i decided to give these a try with the iphone 2g that i have even though the panasonic specs does not list it as compatible i am happy to report that it is compatible but with a few caveats here are the pro and cons    pros  great clarity as per specs i can get 3040 feet and through a wall before audio dropout   receiver lasts 45 hours of constant ipodinternet radio play  handsfreemic quality is quite good so basically when a call comes the ipod music will stop and you can accept or reject the call from the transmittermic button and then resume from previous point on track  can be hooked to either stock buds or a aftermarket set or even to an external audio device such as stereo amp car stereo or tabletop radio with aux input i have ditched the ok panny earbuds for some bo earphones  receiver unit can be charged by usbmini cable included or outletalso included  receiver unit remembers previous pairings  even from different bluetooth unitssaves time    cons  transmitter unit that attaches to my iphone 2g as per previous reviewer does not fit snug but is acceptable also for the design enthusiasts the transmitter that plugs into the iphone dock exudes 18 inch per side  receiver unit cannot charge and simultaneously receive signal this sucks for me as i initially bought this unit to leave the receiver plugged in all the time and connect various devicesipod  on the go but no go  initial pairing is a itch but once established  is good to go  minor pointincoming calls whilst on internet radio or pandora or lastfm does cause havoc by resetting system pair    conclusion  all in all for the price you cannot complainat this point in time the inherent features that this unit possess
2011-12-28,2.0,1,4,8,panasonic rpdjs400 dj street model headphones,i spent the extra 15 for its cool white color i wanted a white headphone it looks very nice on the picture but from what i received its definitely not as white its a bit creamyvanilla white it looks a bit old what im trying to say is its not apple like whitebr br as for the quality of the sound its good like everyone else said it fits me but tight it doesnt hurt or numb my ear right away but it gets irritating after 1015 min hope it gets easy as i wear it ive never owned a headphone before so i cant really compare the product but one thing though i cant lay my head down to watch it i have to keep my head off the pillow also if you wear glasses well good luck tough to wear both of thembr br noise cancellation is normal it doesnt take out all the waybr br updatebr br hurts my ear like a b very uncomfortable i was really hoping after this many months itd get soft and comfy but it just hasnt i havent worn it in a long time its just been laying there waste of 40 ugh

2012-12-12,3.5,2,0,0,philips actionfit inear headphones tuned for sports,i love this type of ear phone  i cant wear a plain ear bud like the ipod kind nor the in the ear ones they either fall out or hurt  i can cycle and run in these pain free and they stay in yayive gotten these a couple times and really cant say much about them positive  they arent particularly comfortable and within a couple months one of the buds stops putting out sound  i attribute this to sweat messing with the audio but who knows could be my shuffle and if so ill pull this review  still though im moving on from these cheap ear buds to something with a better rating

2013-12-27,3.0,1,0,0,philips adjustable earclip headphones,i have mixed feelings about this productbr bought them for the gym and they were perfect i have strange ears it seems because i have a very difficult time finding earclip headphones that fit right these were snug and the sound quality was very goodbr however after lending them to my niece she broke off one of the arms by accidentbr the plastic arms are 34adjustable34but if you twist it a certain way the arm breaks offbr so  since i enjoyed the sound  fit  i replaced them with a new pairbr within a month those too were broken by my daughter this timebr i dont know what to say they arent toddlers and they arent animalsso the fact that both pairs were broken so easily must be endemic to the design of the unit i havent read any of the other reviews but id be interested in seeing if anyone else has had this issue

2011-09-13,5.0,1,2,2,philips gogear vibe mp3 player,this is an easy to use mp3 player with great sound and which lasts a long time between charges i got it a few weeks before hurricane irene caused me to lose power for three days  this player came in very handy during the blackout and did not need to be recharged until after i got power back this is my first mp3 player i cant believe i lived without one for so long    there is a booklet which tells you how to get started but gives little other  information a detailed manual is available online and philips customer support is great      most of how everything works is intuitive for instance while you can download philips songbird to help copy songs to the player i just used the copy and past feature to transfer downloads from my windows 7 music library to the mp3 player to do the job    features on the mp3 player are accessed easily enough though i did find some of the control buttons small  still considering the size of the mp3 player i am not sure if they could have been made much bigger    i have heard horror stories about ear buds that come with mp3 players but i am pleased with the ones that came this player  they are comfortable and sound great the fm sound quality and reception is also great    i have played this in my car using the usb port to connect the mp3 player to my car radio  it is so much easier using this mp3 player rather than sifting though a bunch of cds     this can be charged on a computer as well as when connected to the usb port in a car     my only complaint is that i wish this came with a case because i am afraid i will lose this or break it because of its size           while i enjoy using this daily it really did make life easier during the blackout caused by hurricane irene  listening to my favorite music during s stressfull time when the only thing available was a battery operated radio made a big difference i know blackouts are rare but i am glad i had this during that time    this is my first experience with an mp3 player i cant believe i lived without one for so long
2007-07-03,2.0,1,6,12,philips mcd908 divx dvd micro theatre system discontinued by manufacturer,a little disappointed with the tube quality sound  also after a cd is played the unit powers off  there is some unatural sounds when the cd is loaded you have to reject the disc and reinsertbr br i think this unit has a great market of potential buyers but i believe the unit is premature in its release  if i had to do it all over i would not purchase this unit

2009-10-29,5.0,1,3,3,pioneer vsx1019ahk 7channel home theater receiver black discontinued by manufacturer,after using an lg brand htib for many years it was time for an upgrade   i purchased the vsx1019 along with bose acoustimass 6 series iii  i use the pioneer 90 music 10 movies  games      i listen to all of my music on vinyl on the numark ttx1 connected to the receiver via digital coaxial  my main concern before buying is was whether or not it can force a stereo source turntable  or non dolby 51 television shows through all 5 speakers  which it can     bluray dvd and ps3 games sound great crisp bass and low frequencies and the vocals are loud and clear    i rarely use the ipod feature but the ipod connectivity is certainly a plus an ipod cord comes with the unit so theres no need to buy an additional dock or connection cord the onscreen display including album artwork is a nice touch however scrolling through thousands of songs or playlists on screen can be sluggish its best to use the ipod control feature highly compressed mp3s sound excellent higher bitrate mp3s sound even better    set up is a simple the auto mic speaker setup is accurate and easy to use its simple to manually adjust the settings afterwards although i felt no need to do so    if you are currently using an all in one home theater in a box or are looking for an upgrade to your current receiver with more connectivity and features i highly recommend this product

2014-01-17,4.0,1,2,3,pioneer vsx1123 72channel network av receiver black,after returning a sony 1040 because of hdmi issues  i purchased the pioneer at best buybr the goodbr  ipad app that has an interactive user manual  very cool if you have an ipadbr  video conversion was solid with a good looking picturebr  plenty of adjustments to fine tunebr  having two hdmi out ports that will send separate hdmi signals plus the hd zonebr  connect to home network for music filesbr the badbr  has bluetooth if you  buy an adapter  two salesman swore it was built inbr  has wifi if you buy an adapter  not a biggie for me to hardwirebr  deceiving output wattage hence read the fine printbr  even with all the different setting i found the sound quality disappointing compared to the sony 1040br  no paper manual it comes with a disk for windows if i didnt have an ipad setting it up would have been difficultbr  setup is somewhat confusing  it takes some time and patiencebr  i am only able to access one computer for music through network connection even though they all appear on screenbr  could not get it to update firmwarebr in conclusion it is an ok receiver with ok sound unless  wifi and bluetooth adapters are included it is overpriced at 500 i have a week or more to decide whether to return it  the biggest issue for me is the sound quality is not up to what i hoped  the sony 1040 definitely was a better sounding receiver imobr update  after playing with the receiver a bit more i have found that bluetooth would probably just be redundant  i have been able to connect my ipad and android with the icontrolav app  i do like this receiver and will keep it but still feel that they were not as forthcoming as they could have been about what it does have and doesnt have otherwise it would have been an easy 5 stars
2009-08-06,4.0,1,33,34,pioneer vsx519vk 5channel av receiver black discontinued by manufacturer,the pioneer vsx519v is an entry level 51 receiver made by pioneer yet dont let the fact that it is the cheapest 51 receiver they carry turn you away this product has plenty bang for its buck the receiver has an excellent build and a sleek look to it but that is not all the receiver has a plethura of connections ranging from hdmi optical digital coaxial component analog video and of course and antenna hookup the only hookup missing is svideo the receiver handles video signals well i cannot discern any degredation of video quality when compared to a direct video hookup to the television now moving onto the real reason someone would buy this surround sound this receiever can power my bose acoustimass series i speaker system very well it gets very loud and there are no signs of the speakers being underpowered for volume control there is a knob on the right front side you can turn the sound level ranges from 1 to 80 which does strike me as a bit odd why only to eighty why not a hundred instead you can also adjust the volume with the included remote the remote is very substantial and lets you control any and every setting the receiver has the remote takes 2 aaa batteries to work a pair is of course included functions there are many effects and settings you can change on the receiver but most are uneeded and will most likely be overlooked an example of these includes the settings for different types of music such as rock and classical you are better off just leaving these options alone however is you are interested the manual is very thorough and describes this receivers features in much greater detail all you need to know is this receiver supports dolby digital 51 dts and dolby prologic ii for your stereo encoded sources when you play a dvd that supports say dts the receiver will automatically detect this and switch to that setting so for movies television shows videogames and music this projector has it covered however thereare a few downsides the receiver does not support hdmi passthrough for audio sources this means you cant hook all your audio souces up and then run them through one hdmi and have it transfer all your audio signals through that one hdmi cable only more expensive receivers support this feature it also has no upscaling feature which is no surprise for a sub receiver and finally the reason i give it 45 stars instead of 55 the receiver is advertised as having 5x110 watts for a total of 550 watts and 110 watts per channel at an excellent 05 distortion level this is not entirely true while it may be true in some respects it is a bit deceiving in the manual it states continuous average power output of 80 watts per channel min at 8 ohms from 20hz to 20 000hz with no more than 02 total harmonic distortion so it makes you wonder if you one can really trust wattage and distortion levels it may be able to push a 110 watts a channel but at continuous average power at 20hz20000hz with 05 distortion it seems not anyway if you are looking for an entrylevel home theatre receiver for your 51 system and are on a budget look no further
2014-02-02,5.0,1,0,0,pioneer vsx519vk 5channel av receiver black discontinued by manufacturer,i have owned this receiver for over 2 years now and recently have always used the fiber optic hookups i recently decided to use the hdmi input for the ps4 tuned it for the room and have heard such a great sound quality before i am thoroughly impressed i invited friends over for a movie night and now they are convinced that it is a must have item i think its an insult to call this an entry level receiver because i cant imagine it being much better dts hd is remarkable you just have to remember to select dts output on what you are broadcasting from works great with the iphone as well through the aux input
2013-11-22,4.0,2,4,8,pioneer xwsma1k a1 wifi speaker featuring airplay dlnatm htc connect and wireless direct discontinued by manufacturer,first of all i am glad i read the rest of your reviews before buying this all of them especially the negative ones helped my decision and set my expectations low enough that i am giving this one 5 stars let me explainbr br has anyone out there got such a great wireless connection free of interference that they never get 34cutouts34 when listening to music wirelessly i have airport express apple tv mac mini and a dozen or so windowsbased computers when any one of them is wireless i get cutouts almost every song whether thats due to my urban environment my wireless phones my neighbors wireless crap or lead in my walls i dont care to speculate so i ran ethernet wires everywhere i needed ethernet a combination of cat5e and cat6 if you care and thats how i use this devicebr br i have set up multiple music zones throughout the house with the exception of my office and my living room none of these zones need to have topnotch audio in the past i have used the altec lansing iphoneoriented boxes in concert with an airport express wired of course its a good solution but a bit cumbersome it requires two devices both of which must be powered and as many have noted it turns itself off very quickly this gizmo has neither of those drawbacks it has a wake on lan feature so you can turn it off and on remotely and its very compact i bought one to put in my sons rec room because i got tired of running down there to turn on the altec system every time he wanted music while he played now i just pull out my iphone or ipad you can use your computer also select a playlist or other music choice on itunes and press play i choose the speaker from one of the airplay devices the speaker sees that i am trying to play music to it it turns itself on and i have loud music and a quiet kid when he finally emerges from the basement i turn off the music on my phone and the speaker figures out that its time to sleepbr br as someone whos made his living by putting reliable networks together i can tell you that its best to just ignore the damn wireless part bite the bullet and run some cables once youve done that its a lot more liberating than you realizebr br the only regret i have about this and essentially every other product is that they clearly put a large part of the cost into a 80211 interface if they would just dump those it could be 10 or 115 bucks cheaper i bet some day the world will come around to my way of thinking but for now this is a pretty awesome deal for less than 70 bucksbr br the sound quality is good not great but i didnt expect bosequality sound for this pricebe careful most of the reviews here are for the a4 not the a1 difference beetween them is important so
2013-07-17,4.0,1,1,2,pioneer xwsma4k wifi speaker featuring airplay dlna htc connect and wireless direct discontinued by manufacturer,i got it since i have everything apple so using airplay is good there are however a few drawbacks i found so farbr br  the iphone app is very limited and basically all it does is volume control no equaliser no bass reduction everything else it has like pandora or access to music collection can be simply used in the apps which have airplay support anyway

2014-02-04,5.0,1,0,1,polk audio camden square wireless portable speaker,coming off the scales just under 5 pounds the polk camden square comes out of its impressively styled box like a bear out of hibernation lean and growling with impressive bass admittedly the analogy stops there because the device is far more attractive than any hibernating bear ive seen it fits and carries easily in a small messenger bag plays wirelessly after a short charge and lets me take my music with me from room to room at work most importantly it doesnt require physical connection with my iphone bluetooth connection works from two rooms away without so much as a hiccup which means im less likely to leave my phone behind if i have to run out of the room a regrettably common occurrence with my older portable bose system the clean sound easily fills a small to medium sized room with impressive sound

2008-05-02,5.0,1,0,0,polk audio psw10 monitor series powered subwoofer single,i purchased this subwoofer due to its brand reputation low price point and to match the rest of my system 4 x r30s front and rear and 1 x csr center    the sound is what you would expect from a nice but budget priced polk subwoofer  it really does open up the sound range from your home audio system      cons first the subwoofer box does not contain a subwoofer cable or a ysplitter for a subwoofer to dual rca jacks  since this model has dual inputs for a single subwoofer channel you can run a single subwoofer cable from your receiver but the adjustments imo are easier and sound better when used with a splitter    overall great price at under 150 shipped  great sound  matches well in sound and color with other polk speakers  all in all a great buy for the price
2010-11-09,5.0,1,2,2,polk audio psw505 12inch powered subwoofer single black,at first i was apprehensive buying this sub from jr music world instead from amazoncom but decided to take the plunge and paid only 229 shipping included  man this sub sounds great considering i am used to listening to a 15inch downfiring 1000 watt doubleradiator  topoftheline infinity subwoofer that costs around 1500 this polk subwoofer is loud and goes down really low maybe 25hz or 23 as advertised i fell in love with my ht again  oh btw this sub is really not that big but i think for a 12inch driver its box is quite small the 3year warranty on its amplifier and 5 years on its driver is just great compared to name brands that usually comes 1 year only if you are hesitating to get this sub well dont  get it while it lasts because as you may already know this model is already discontinued
2013-04-19,5.0,1,0,0,polk audio psw505 12inch powered subwoofer single black,this thing is ridiculous  ive listened to subs that costs upwards of two times the price of this thing and cant compete  this thing sounds excellent through the majority of the range  only issue i have with it is when you get to a really low frequency and it seems to strain ever so slightly but its not a big deal  do not buy this if you live in an apartment  you will make your neighbors angry  this thing is meant to be in a larger room of a house  this thing is so nice i bought a second one to round it out  after all the first rule of purchasing a subwoofer is why have one when you can have two twice the pricebr br prosbr  sounds excellentbr  hits hard  it will knock stuff off my walls if i wanted it tobr br consbr  eviction notices if you live in an apartmentbr br you absolutely cant beat this subwoofer at this price point  polk makes excellent speakers all the way around and i would recommend them to anyone

2006-01-28,3.0,1,2,2,rio carbon 5 gb mp3 player,ive had my rio carbon player for about 1 12 years and it has worked flawlessly until recently for the first year i encountered absolutely no problems with the carbon and found that i liked it much more than an ipod due to its sizeshape and how easy it was to use the only complaints that i had in the first year were fairly nitpicky in that the headphones stopped working after about 6 months which isnt a big deal since headphones are easily replaceable i also found it a pain to scroll through all of the artists to find a specific song that i want to listen to because this takes a long time which is one feature in which the ipod is superior the player is fairly easy to use and the software for the computer is also user friendly with easy playlist options and it is also simple to modify the title for the songs it doesnt take very long to upload the music to the player and the player instantly recognizes what songs you already have on it so it wont waste space by duplicating the song on the player i found the carrying case useless since you cannot access the front buttons while it is in its case and it is an extremely tight fit making it difficult to insert and remove the player from its case so i rarely use it when i first purchased this mp3 player the stupid best buy employee told me that it could hold 5000 songs which is what made me choose this product over others however i was extremely disappointed to find that it can only hold between 600700 songs and while that still is a great deal of songs this did not meet my expectations and it came nowhere near the amount of songs i wanted to put on it making it sort of a pain to change my songs and go through all of them to pick and choose which songs i wanted to listen to rather than just having all of my songs at my fingertips recently i have been having problems with my carbon player and have been pleased when i call the customer service center they have been able to help me a great deal each time icall in getting my carbon to function again i have called a total of 4 times in the past 6 months however today i called them since my carbon player said it had no songs on it but when i plugged it into my computer it said that the player was full and they tried to help me as best they could but ultimately they told me in the sweetest way they could that there was an internal issue within my player and that i need to get a new mp3 player which is disappointing since it seems like an mp3 player should last longer than 1 12 years what surprised me most of all was that the rio employee suggested that i research the mp3 player much more before purchasing it which i most certainly will do and that i should really look at other types of mp3 players basically telling me that i should not get another rio carbon 5 gb player i will certainly follow this employees advice and do not plan on purchasing another rio product in the future if you are considering purchasing this mp3 player i recommend that you do so only if you dont mind getting a new one in a year or two but hey you can do what you want this is only my experience with one carbon if you decide to get one hopefully you will have better luck than i did

2011-05-17,1.0,1,2,2,riteav digital optical toslink cable 15 ft,this cable doesnt snap in snugly it just lays there kind of crooked and the slightest bump or movement makes it fall out  also the wire is not 15 feet long  to get that you have to measure from the tip of one connector to the tip of the other  each connector is a good 2 inches long so the actual length of the wire is more like 14 inches
2007-12-01,3.0,1,0,0,rivet stereo earphones  headset,pros  ear buds stay in my ears  sound quality on par with most headphones  bass is ok  treble is ok neither great  i like the cloth cords  easy to untangle  hanging it around the neck is nice since you can take out the buds if you need to do something like have a short conversation with someone or something similar instead of sticking it in your pocket or winding it up around your iphone  very convenient looks nice    cons  the main thing i hate most about this is the position where the microphone is placed  it is weird  it is on the part of the loop that goes around the neck  my problem is that i can never find it when i am wearing it  it moves  sometimes it goes behind my neck most of the time it is on the side of my neck  but the main thing is that it hides  sound quality of the mic really depends on what environment you are using it in  it does fairly well in seminoisy places the length of the cord from ear to plug is a bit too short  when placed in the pocket it is just right but when i turn or do some sort of weird twisting or climbing the buds get pulled out of my ears  the quality is not a more like c  the buds are not well made and crackling can be heard when inserting the buds  blocks out too much noise  when you have one in your ear when driving it just feels weird it is worse when the bud is in your ear but not on a call  but then again it could be a personal thing    bottom line  not too bad for the price  cheaper than the vmoda but much less quality sound quality is good  design is wacky  i can never find the microphone  the microphone wont stay put  yet it is easy to use and is cheap  3 stars because it just works nicely  took off 2 because of weird mic placement that really infuriated me and a lackluster sound quality

2007-06-27,2.0,1,4,4,samsung tr50x3b adjustable dlp tv stand for hls5086 hls5087 hls5686 hls5687 hls6186 and hls6187 discontinued by manufacturer,i ordered this stand in tandem with the 61 television  i was hoping that a stand from samsung matched to my samsung tv would simplify matters for me but that wasnt the case  in fact the stand has turnedout to be my greatest source of headaches      the first stand came to me damaged  now i had not opened the pkg while the delivery man was present  although i probably should have  the package looked like it had been opened during shipment  all of the wood is made from particle board and is therefore very easily damaged  the package had been dropped and one of the corners of the shelfs was smashed      amazon was good about getting a replacement to me  it arrived two days later  the appearance of the replacement package looked better  this time i opened it and gave a quick inspection of all the components prior to the driver leaving  i found that similar damage had taken place to the same component in a different location  this time the damage was in a location where it would not be visible once assembled  once again amazon was helpful in that they refunded 20 of the purchase price for the damage  i had wasted enough time on the stand  i just wanted the matter closed  the tv was late being delayed but was going to arrive the following morning  i was simply out of time  after seeing how its packaged im not all that surprised that they have difficulty delivering the item in perfect condition      during assembly i noted several other complaints with this item  the finish left quite a bit to be desired just poor workmanship  one piece in particular had a pretty poor finish on it  but its not noticeable once assembled  the glass shelf support structure is second rate  there are some guides for the glass panels that afix to some threaded inserts on the back panel  when i fastened one of them into the back panel one of the threaded inserts stripped out  a visual inspection of the hole revealed a portion of a drill bit that some dumb jerk on the assembly line broke off and incredibly left inside the hole  so naturally once i threaded in the fastener it bottomed out on the broken drill bit and shoved the threaded insert out of the hole  very poor quality control by samsung andor their supplier i hope the tv isnt this poor  i managed to partially seat the glass panel guide  i was afraid to try and drill out the remaining drill bit  its not right  but it should be functional      so now its sitting there all put together  and im generally pleased with its appearance  i have not installed any components to the shelves yet  but i can see how the other complaints about a lack of space could be a problem  if you are like me youd probably never buy a black automobile  keeping one clean would simply be too much trouble  i suspect that im going to wish that i had selected something in a different color  this thing looks like it is going to be a dust magnet    if i could do this over again id purchase a stand from a local business  and i doubt i would go with this particular one  there is simply no way that i saved enough money by purchasing this item online to compensate me for the headaches and lack of quality the stand has given me
2008-08-03,4.0,1,3,3,sandisk sansa clip 2 gb mp3 player  black,very small but easy to use all controls the clip is a nice feature while exercising walking for me keeps it in your pocket or whatever works well with windows media player so adding or deleting files is no problem the battery seems to last me a week or more  using the player about an hour or two a day
2008-08-15,5.0,1,0,0,sandisk sansa clip 2 gb mp3 player  black,very nice and small mp3 with many cool extras at a very cheap price mine arrived 2 days after ordering its a good buy
2010-10-09,5.0,1,1,1,sandisk sansa fuze 8 gb video mp3 player,bought two of these units one for me and the other for family member we both use them mainly for audio books these units are well worth the money put 8gb flash card in it and it holds all of my audible books with plenty of room to spare the only drawback is that the unit does not allow book marking so that you can start where you left off
2011-10-14,4.0,1,0,0,sandisk sansa e270 6 gb mp3 player with sd expansion slot,not an exciting player but one that works well  ive had my 6 gig for 3 years now and use it 8 hours a day  my usb is half connected to the computer so that it can work as a charging station  i never worry about it going low on power
2007-04-19,3.0,1,2,2,sandisk sansa m240 1 gb mp3 player,i bought this since my old computer died and i had to get a new pc with vista well the software for my minidisc wont install on vista so i needed an mp3 player to listen to new music that isnt already on my minidiscs well there wasnt any warning here that the software for the sansa isnt compatable with vista either but since its a flash drive winblows will recognize it just like any other removable drive and you can drag your mp3s in that way the only negatives are not being able to organize your music and battery life for one 1gb is all that i need since im picky about music but i also listen to two very different styles of music  the loud heavy industrial and 80s  oldies pop hits unfortunately theres no way to separate them because the sansa doesnt keep folders like a minidisc or ipod so all the music is mixed in together and it plays your music in alphebetical order by song title also 19 hours isnt much considering the minidisc runs for 56 hours on one battery but overall im addicted to my little sansa as music is as vital to me as oxygen and the radio reception is not as bad as everyone else is saying it is its got better reception than my sterio even and can pick up all the other stations that are drowned out by vaqs overpowering signal if you live in morgantown you know what im talking about

2007-10-30,5.0,1,1,1,sangean hdt1 hd radio component tuner discontinued by manufacturer,i recently purchased the sangean hd tuner because of a change in the analogue signal that left us without classical music  the classical music was available in hd from the same frequency that had previously carried the analogue classical signal  i find the reception to be a great improvement over the analogue signal and the sangean tuner is easy to use providing excellent reception as if we were playing a cd

2009-12-18,4.0,1,0,0,sangean rs330 digital amfm clock radio discontinued by manufacturer,all in all this is a great clock radio very well designed the one flaw ive found is that the snooze is fixed at 5 minutes some of us find that too short and there doesnt seem to be a way to adjust it one nice feature is that even with headphones plugged in it still wakes to the radio normally plugging in headphones cuts off the external sound but the alarm is an exception well designed in this respect at least also nice is that the alarm sound gradually gets louder

2010-02-06,5.0,1,0,0,sanyo eneloop aa nimh precharged rechargeable batteries  4 pack discontinued by manufacturer,ive used energizer rechargeable batteries in the past and recently decided to make the switch to these sanyo eneloop batteries first its nice that they come precharged so far they seem to hold a good amount of energy before they die and ive read that the capacity gradually increases after the first few charges ive used these batteries for video game controllers a camera flash unit and a graphing calculator the graphing calculator will be the best measure of how slowly they selfdischarge over time so far they do seem to discharge slower than the energizer batteries when used in the video game controllers and they seem to last longer when used in the camera flash unit the eneloop batteries are also quite aesthetically pleasing
2010-09-27,5.0,1,0,0,sanyo eneloop aa nimh precharged rechargeable batteries  8 pack discontinued by manufacturer,ive been using eneloop batteries for couple of years now and love it i have two little ones and there is always a toy that needs a new set of batteries
2011-04-28,5.0,1,0,0,sanyo eneloop aa nimh precharged rechargeable batteries  8 pack discontinued by manufacturer,nice price even after shipping to canadabr br i just bought a logitech harmony remote which has a color screen and went through a new set of duracell aas in 2 monthsaand along with that my logitech wireless pc controller and flashlights i figured that i needed some high quality rechargables after reading reviews of battery life on photographyenthusiast websites i chose the easytofind eneloopsbr br they charge quickly in my regular nimh charger and dont get too toasty apparently these things hold a charge for a long time but i have yet to use the last pair if i think of it ill update this review whenever i get around to using them and see how much of a charge theyve keptbr br and oddly enough theyre more or less solid white which makes them very easy to find when dropped an unexpected surprisebr br id say that id buy more but if they last as long as the pros says they do i likely will not have to maybe some aaasbr br they also arrived inside of two weeks to norther alberta pretty quickbr br update today i slapped my last unused set into my charger adn it still says theyre fully charged nice the first set i used for aforementioned logitech remote ive had to recharge 3 times and i see no change in duration i think ill ahve to buy some aaas

2013-08-16,5.0,2,0,0,sanyo new 1500 eneloop aa nimh precharged rechargeable batteries,i purchased both the 4pack and 8pack of these batteries for the second time a month or so ago  they are excellent originally i was drawn to the eneloops due to several very favorable tests that show how durable and reliable they are which is key for me  everything in our house runs on eneloops at this point over 60 aa and aaa batteries in total and i cant express just how happy i am with these  they even come precharged which is extremely nice because you can pop them right out of the package just like disposables and get rollinas a video producer i have many gadgets which run on aa batteries so naturally i can burn through some aa batteries in no time  these rechargeable batteries have already paid for themselves several times over and still seem just as good as the day i bought them  i do recommend getting your hands on a second charger as the charge time can take quite a while for 4 batteries

2011-12-08,5.0,1,1,1,satechi bt wireless bluetooth portable speaker system for mp3 players,i bought one of these speakers and it worked great the sound quality was excellent for such a small speaker and its wireless which is amazing i dont have to keep my iphone hooked up to the speaker the whole time and can wonder where ever i want within bluetooth range which i might add is fairly far i took my iphone all the way upstairs and the sound was still perfect the only drawback about this product is that you are supposed to be able to connect more than one and you can but when you do the sound isnt nearly as good it sounds better with one speaker than with two connected but other than that i would highly recommend this product

2011-11-03,5.0,1,3,3,sendstation dock extender for ipod white discontinued by manufacturer,this product works perfectly for an iphone 4s in an otterbox defender case  the one downside is the stand portion that ships replaces your current dock insert and that part does not clip in correctly  this is not a big deal because the extender holds it down
2015-04-29,3.0,1,0,0,sennheiser cx 300 ii precision enhanced bass earbuds,ordered on february 21 2013br april 28th 2015 left ear connector died2 years of lifespan for occasional use and good care is not good enough in my opinion
2014-06-04,5.0,1,1,1,sennheiser cx 300 ii precision enhanced bass earbuds black,i just replaced these for a lost set of 25 sony earbuds that i was using for years and couldnt be happier  these buds are loud  bass is rich but not overwhelming mids are punchy highs are a little flat but can still hear very well  the only thing i dont like is the 1834 l connector is raised a little bit too high and sits about 1234 from the device but other than that everything is living up to sennheisers reputation  for 30 i would recommend and purchase again
2015-01-26,4.0,1,0,0,sennheiser cx 300 ii precision enhanced bass earbuds black,these are great earbuds however i must have weird ears they just will not stay on the sound is rich and they are confortable to wear i think most people will enjoy them
2012-01-02,4.0,1,0,0,sennheiser closed circumaural hifi headphone with enhanced bass,not what i expected they sound like cheap headphones sound gets destroyed when i set the volume high which is the regular volume level i listen toabout 34 of the ipod volume bar
2014-05-19,5.0,1,0,0,sennheiser digital wireless headphones,the headphones surpassed my expectations  i wear hearing aides and i get no feedback when using the headphonesbr the audio is clear and crisp  i had used a lower priced sennheiser wireless headphone for the past 2 years but was having difficulty maintaining a battery charge  the 180s are much improved and superior sound quality remains excellent as i walk outside to my patio or anywhere in my condo i recommend this product
2011-04-13,5.0,1,1,1,sennheiser dynamic stereo sound audiophile 500 series headphones,i purchased these headphones about 5 days ago and they arrived today and after sampling some music and now watching a movie they work so well ive had to nearly mute everything to keep my hearing they do seem to handle the various sounds very well as they should for this price they also fit comfortably despite my having a pretty big head the cord and plug are heavy duty and look like they could be run over for half an hour and be cleaned up with a simple damp cloth to sum up these are some impressive headphones at a completely reasonable price for high quality and in my opinion completely worth the investment    should any problems happen in the future i will edit that into this review thank you
2008-11-23,5.0,1,0,0,sennheiser eh150 dynamic sound evolution hifi stereo headphones,i have had sennheiser microphones for over 30 years that are still unmatched in qualitynice to find that though the prices have come down the products are still pleasing im using these presently in combination with a zoom h2

2011-06-11,3.0,1,0,0,sennheiser earfin sports earbuds,ive been using these for a couple months and theyre okay thats really the based way to summarize them    things of note    1 sound quality is excellent if the earbuds fit correctly in your ears they come with three sets of bud covers small medium large to allow you select the one that best fits your ear if youre somewhere in between these sizes then youll not get the proper low end sound that you should get because theyre not properly snug its very important you use the right size    2 theres a lot of cord noise if youre exercising in a manner that causes the cord to bounce around a lot i found this to be very surprising since these headphones are made for activities that cause that to happen fortunately it comes with a clip that you can clip onto your towel a pocket or the top of your shirt so the noise will be reduced due to it not bouncing as much if you dont clip it though the weight of the volume controlclip will make it bounce hard and frequently    3 the buds seem to slip out a lot for me due to small amounts of fluid that is generated when using these type of headphones if your ears arent dry and clean theyre going to slip out a lot bear in mind that the little ear holders the buds clip do to a good job of keeping them reasonably in your ear but they slide out just enough to loose the seal on the bud and therefore the low end sound quality dies    overall id look for something better and im surprised that sennheiser didnt produce the type of quality product theyre known for if not you could certainly do a lot worse
2010-04-22,5.0,1,1,1,sennheiser hd 238 open aire stereo headphones,i listen to classic rock music on my mac with alteclansing speakers with a subwoofer  i often have to suppress the bass and volume so as not to disturb others at homebr br i decided to get headphones but knew i did not want overtheear closed headphones due to weight and comfort  i recalled a friends sennheiser openair headphones from the 70sbr br i am listening to hendrix right now i am a huge fan and hearing details that i havent been able to perceive in over 30 years  i thought i had lost my high and low range  they are also comfortablebr br i think these are great and recommend them very highly for both performance and price
2015-04-15,5.0,1,0,0,sennheiser headphones,these headphones definitely live up to the hype that theyve received great for gaming super comfortable theyre currently hooked up to a astro mixamp pro on my xbox one the sound is superb and directional awareness is among the best youll want to get creative if you want a mic but thats where the antlion mod mic comes in if youre looking for a great pair of headphones for listening to music and gaming look no further i did plenty of research before deciding to invest in these
2009-01-16,4.0,1,0,1,sennheiser inear stereo headphone,the quality of the bass is super  when u put it u will travel in an other world cause the sound is very pure and you cant hear the surrounding  small  problem that when u put it u dont hear anything else so its a little bit dangerous to use it when u are walking in streets cause u wont hear the traffic at all second prob u wont hear evan your voice so its difficult to sing when u put it p
2009-04-01,5.0,1,0,0,sennheiser inear stereo headphone,ive been through a few headphones in my life and have always been pleased with the sennheiser products  at under 20 the cx300 earbuds are the best value around  if you look at the specs youll see that the frequency range and impedance match or nearly match that of much more expensive earbuds even ones made by sennheiser  the noise isolation is also pretty good here

2010-07-12,5.0,1,0,0,sennheiser lightweight collapsible headphones,i have owned the px100s for about 3 months now and am wearing them off and on all day at work every day while they lose to my sennheiser hd650s on every other point their sound quality for this price range is fantastic   if you like relatively bassheavy music and dont want to be bothered with a headphone amp then these should be about right i had never heard this much bass response in unamped inexpensive headphones before without noticeable distortion the carrying case with these is very well thought out and convenient i will say that i can only wear them for an hour or two at a time before ear fatigue starts kicking in  a handful of my friends also own these phones and claim that they can wear them all day my ears stick out from my head more than most though    pros  sound quality especially bass easily driven by an iphone no amp required plug is extremely narrow for fitting through odd pmp cases    cons supraaural they sit directly against your ears appear moderately fragile look kind of cheap flimsy cable
2006-11-05,4.0,1,2,3,sennheiser lightweight inear headphone,the sound range and clarity is quite good they are comfortable my only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes id like to use it with my computer not a mp3 attached to my belt
2007-09-10,5.0,1,1,1,sennheiser lightweight semicircumaural headphones  silver,i am a video editor and have been needing some decent headphones for a long while  these dont cut out all surrounding sound but they do a pretty darn good job for the price  i have been very pleased so far and even use them to listen to my music because it sounds so much better through these headphones
2008-01-28,3.0,1,1,1,sennheiser lightweight semicircumaural headphones  silver,these headphones are comfortable completely cover your ear and sound wonderful i used them happily for about 2 years but then the cord went bad as often happens with headphones i cant find any replacement cords online so theyre not much use to me anymore it seems these models with longer cords have more problems more cord  more chance to break somewhere along the line however i would recommend these based on comfort and sound

2009-04-23,1.0,1,0,0,sennheiser onear 926mhz wireless rf headphones with charging cradle,product is physically made well however i pick up all sorts of interference most of the time i just get static
2014-03-01,1.0,1,0,0,sennheiser onear 926mhz wireless rf headphones with charging cradle,right out of the box there were troubles with this unit  when i tried to insert the rechargeable batteries in behind one of the ear pieces the ear piece never fit on properly again  the unit we received has very poor volume and does not recharge well  we may have just gotten a bad one  i plan to send it back and exchange it for another that i hope will work better
2014-07-29,5.0,1,2,2,sennheiser pmx95 neckband portable headphones,if youre an audiophile snob then youre not reading this and you wont care what i think but if youre giving these any serious look then i recommend them without hesitation ive owned and used some toptier headphones over the years and these pmx95s dont make me feel that im missing anything i would buy this same model again if these were lost or stolen
2011-11-01,2.0,1,0,0,sennheiser sports earbud headphones,this product was welldesigned from a functional standpoint in that comfort was good and sound was reasonable  however from a reliability perspective i was disappointed  after only a couple of months of light use the headphones stopped working and i could tell that there was a break in the cable near the jack  not that i expect too much at this price level but complete failure is pretty disappointing
2006-12-26,1.0,1,7,14,sennheiser wireless surround sound headphones,description led me to believe i could sit and read a book while my husband listened to the tv through the headphones  volume on the tv had to be so loud before he could get the headphones to work that it was impossible  tried with our new tv and same thing  tried watching tv together with tv volume low where i like it and he couldnt hear anything through the headset i tried them on and i couldnt either so it wasnt his hearing  sending them back  notice instruction booklet says br  br under modulation audio signal too low br if this happens the volume on the sound source is too low br  br guess sleeping beside someone watching tv is out too

2011-02-04,3.0,1,1,1,sentry gears inear buds,i bought the sentury woodies and they sounded pretty good for gym use  i bought these at big lots for 5 and like them better  the highs are a little bit more natural and the lows arent as strong as the sentury woodies at 5 with 4 different size buds to choose from you cannot go wrong  the only downside is they are not marked right ear or left ear  thats why i gave 4 stars instead of 5br br great gym use buds  they stay in my earsbr br br updatebr br i went back to get two more pair seems each pair sounds different  i got lucky with the first ones in that they sounded great  the other two were lacking bass and tinny i returned them both  so id try a couple you might hit a good sounding pair if not just return it

2010-10-23,5.0,1,0,0,skullcandy inkd earbuds,great product i have owned several in the past i will buy again in the future
2011-04-16,1.0,1,3,4,skullcandy inkd earbuds,these have some really good sound to them however you have to jam them into your ear canal to make them work jamming them into the ear canal is way uncomfortable i have tried all of the rubber ends that come with them and none of them work also be careful because they will come out of your ear at the slightest tug
2012-03-26,1.0,1,0,0,skullcandy inkd earbuds,the sound quality is great if you are accustomed to regular ear buds that do not enter the ear canal i would not recommend going with these they are extremely uncomfortable and if used for a prolonged time can cause extreme discomfort and headaches

2014-09-13,2.0,1,0,0,skullcandy inkd micd 2,i have bought three pairs of these earbuds now two for myself and one for my daughter  while the sound is great my daughters stopped working after a short time as did my second pair  my first pair cracked around the right earbud which make it come apart  i only bought a second pair because the sound was good and i thought it might be a fluke  however now im going to to give panasonic a try
2014-12-16,2.0,1,0,0,skullcandy inkd micd 2,im not going to go into depth about the durability and use as i bought these to simply hold me over before i buy a better pair i dont expect them to last foreverbr br however i must say the sound is somewhat what you pay for unbalanced with rediculously bass im writing this review simply because the bass is so overdone if you listen to hip hop or rap at all these will destroy your ears no joke if your fix is anything but these genres classical jazz acoustic etc the bass will intrude on your music i decided to use the 34spoken word34 eq on my iphone to make it bearable even then its very present do yourself a favor and do some research for the best earphones under 15 if you happen to be on a budget for a cheap pairbr br thats all
2008-05-06,4.0,1,0,0,skullcandy inkd smokin buds earphones  blue,as the other reviews say these have really great isolation and good sound they come with 3 different sizes so most likely they will fit your ears i tested these against the sony fontopias sp which are 2030 dollars and i can honestly say that these are better in sound and comfort i also own the skullcandy smokin series which are 2030 and they are sadly worse than this cheaper version highly recommended for value and comfort and awesome isolation    one minor complaint when you have awesome isolation if you bump the cord just a little it sounds like an earthquake

2010-03-02,1.0,1,0,1,skullcandy lowrider headphones  2011,i probably used these headphones for about 20 days before they broke sound only came out of one of the ear piece i regret buying these for sure the sound quality was probably the same as regular 10 dollars one why didnt buy 10 earphones i wasted money since they didnt even last a month and i used them about 10 times max dont buy them
2013-05-09,1.0,1,1,4,skullcandy roc nation aviator black s6avcm003 overear headphones with inline mic,i paid over 200 for these skullcandy aviators after being impressed by the sound quality and the lifetime warrantee well after only a few short months of use the connection became very unstable to the point where it was shorting out all the time  so only one side would workif i jiggled it i could sometimes get stereo sound but not without a lot of messing aroundbr br i contacted the skullcandy in australia and they were totally disinterested in helping me while i admit i didnt have my receipt all i was asking for was a repair  not a replacementbr br so if its a lifetime warrantee why does it matter where and when i purchased them this is just skullcandys way of avoiding their responsibilitybr br if they are worried about the items being fakes then surely skullcandy themselves will know this as soon as they see the productbr br this is just really poor business turns out that in australia you need the proof of purchase receipt to make a claim as compared to the us where you do not how was supposed to know this in advance i am not surebr br companies like apple do warrantees well  they dont care about keeping receipts etc  all they care about is that it is an apple product and they offer 12 months warrantee  take it to any apple store and its donebr br i would say i probably got around 4 months trouble free usage out of these headphones that have only ever been used at homebr br poor build quality backed by even worse customer service here in australia anywaybr br such is my frustration re these headphones that i have created a blog about my experiences at

2014-07-30,4.0,1,0,0,skullcandy titan ear buds w mic,these headphones seem to be a different version then i imagined i believe the cord should be knitted and the metal buds should be a bit heavierbr br quality very nice looking seems durable the metal earbuds feel a bit lighter than they shouldbr price great price considering i got them somewhat used the earbuds sound great for the pricebr br sound i cant give a good review of the sound because i havent burned them in they sound great but should sound even better once burned in pretty good bass so farbr br verdict very nice earbuds for the price skullcandy is by far my favorite earbudheadphone brand out there highly reccomendation

2008-01-19,5.0,1,4,4,sony 4 gb walkman video mp3 player white,i like this player very much i bought this player to use when i exercise it is small lite weight and very easy to use  another reason i chose it was for the headphones they are just what i wantedvery comfortable and they put out great sound  i have a much larger player made by creative which is still going strong but is much too big for what i needed it for  the only area of discontent is the storage capacity sony will tell you that it holds up to 2000 songs but those songs all have to be about 2 minutes long  i have close to 700 songs and i am almost out of space because most of my songs are 36 minutes long  make sure you chose the right capacity beyond that this is a great player you cant go wrong

2010-07-10,3.0,1,2,2,sony ex style headphones  hybrid silicone type earbuds,i find the sound to be pretty good which is the most important issue to mebr br a close second is comfort and this is where they fall short in the ear these are comfortable and similar to the older mdr headphones these replaced the right bud on that pair died after 15 months my main complaint is the asymmetrical cord the left cord past the splitter is too short only about six inches and the right cord is much too long about 24 inches is this designed to go around a football helmet instead of a human head the result is lots of extra dangling cord which is a huge bother for runners this should be no more than 10 inches though i much prefer symmetrical cords asymmetrical cords are also much more inconvenient to wrapunwrap around my ipod nano the product description should give these measurements or indicate the cord is asymmetricalbr br update eight months after buying these one of the buds is failing  sound is about 20 the volume of the other no its not my ears  so im reducing the construction quality stars to 2 but leaving the overall rating at 3  i dont expect cheap earbuds to last forever

2010-11-07,5.0,1,4,4,sony icf38 portable amfm radio black,my car radio died and i could not afford 300 for a new radio from car toys so i thought id try out this portable one pull up the antenna and it gets great reception  it was definitely worth the money ive had it for over a month and the batteries are still going strong  the sound quality isnt anywhere near a bose but its a plastic portable radio and for what it is its just about perfect

2009-08-22,5.0,1,1,1,sony mdre10lppblu headphones  fashion earbuds blue,the best 999 that i have ever spentthe sound is great as the sennheiser that i have for way less moneyi have not been shock yet
2013-04-26,4.0,1,1,1,sony mdre818lp fontopia earbud headphones with acoustic twin turbo circuit,these earbuds sound as good as any low end pro quality headphones  the only problem is that they are uncomfortable as hell on your ears especially if youre sensitive  the little foam padding comes off very easily and i lost both of mine so be sure to get some replacement foam for them  the price and sound quality makes these definitely worth buying  i use them when im riding my bike and motorcycle hooked into my sansa clip  they have good enough max volume without distortion or sound quality degradation  if you want something to chill or study with however get some headphones that are comfortable because these definitely arent unless you have huge ears
2013-05-12,5.0,1,0,0,sony mdre828lp fontopia earbuds with winding case,the earbuds in the winding case are convenient for outdoor sporting events because they dont have to be untangled they last for years
2014-08-06,5.0,1,1,1,sony mdrex37b earbud style headphones,i use these for walking on my treadmill i paid only 11 dollars because they were yellow a different color would have cost me 5 more they work well for inexpensive earbuds i dont wear earbuds as a fashion statement so the cheapest color is what i bought
2005-09-02,5.0,1,0,0,sony mdrex51lp fontopia headphones,if you are an owner of a playstation portable or any portable media player for that matterand are looking for a fair priced noise blocking excellent sounding headphone set then these are the ticket  i have owned every type of headphones you can imaginefrom every manufacturer  large over the ear styles earbuds the type that hook over your ears etc etc etc  these are the best  the silicone rubber inserts come in 3 sizes and are super soft yet they fit snuggly into your ears  earbuds make my ears ache after a while  larger headphones let in too much noise but these are wonderful  soundwise they have excellent response  clear highs and mid range and an acceptable bass  you wont regret the purchase
2008-03-03,3.0,1,2,2,sony mdrex71sla fontopia bud style headphones,i bought these to replace a set of sony mdrex51lp earbuds that i lost i was really happy with the sound of the 51s but wanted a carrying case that would contain the earbuds and the cord instead of a case that just holds the earbuds themselves but not the cord like the one that came with the 51s  i was also willing to pay a little more for upgraded sound even though i was happy with the sound of the 51s  so i went ahead and bought the sony mdrex71sla earbudsbr   the bottom line for me is the 71s sound pretty much the same as the 51s  so no improvement there  and while the 71s do come with a carrying case it isnt designed very well  although it seems like an earbud carrying case wouldnt be too complicated its actually kind of tricky to get the cord wrapped and the plugs tucked away inside of it well enough to be able to snap the cover on without pinching the cordbr   overall i really enjoy the sound of these earbuds as well as how comfortable they are in my ears even after wearing them for hours  i just dont think that the carrying case is worth the extra money for the 71s versus the sony 51s
2006-06-06,2.0,1,2,2,sony mdrex81lp budstyle stereo earphones,the sound quality of these earphones is really good  i was very pleased with my purchase until about 4 months 1 month past warranty into them when i noticed bare wire on the cord in two places the cord is very cheaply made and doesnt seem to stand up to the normal wear and tear i love the sound quality but the cord problem can present a serious problem
2007-01-09,3.0,1,2,2,sony mdrex81lp budstyle stereo earphones,i love the sony earbuds i have another pair thats just the earbuds without the back of the ear support  it has excellent noise cancellation does not stress the ear at all the bud is very soft and without blowing your eardrums still has a fair amount of bass carried over  the one main reason i didnt give this model five stars is they are too big for my ears and dont fit or stay at all  i ended up having to give them as a present  there should be at least a size suggestion for example no one using the smaller ear bud size should use these or even a length of ear requirement  considering they are still moderately expensive a size suggestion should be placed on the website
2011-05-26,5.0,1,1,1,sony mdrg57g s2 sports street style headphones with reflective ear piece,amazon just flagged me that i never reviewed this item i bought a couple of years ago  when i clicked on review the item i thought amazon was wrong because of the price of them i would never pay anything close to 100 or more for headphones  thank goodness amazon keeps your purchase history because i clicked on mine and found that i paid just under 26 for these  they worked great until they were mysteriously lost somewhere  i would love another pair but if theyve gone up in price that much then forget it  but for what its worth they were comfortable and worked great
2013-07-04,4.0,2,0,0,sony mdrj10 headphones,i have kinda oddly shaped insides of my ear and these are the only kind of small earphones that i can even stand having in i seriously hated every other ear bud i have tried sure the sound quality could be better but for the price you cant ask for better i will also say these things have some serious durability i was so bummed when i found out i put them through the wash when i forgot to check my pockets i thought i would try them before i tossed them and to my surprise the worked just as good as when i just got them hahahathe only headphone design that does not slip out of my ears and remains comfortable when i run  although thses headphones are not for audiophiles they are more than adequate for listening to music when i exercisebr br delivered on time and for a good price
2005-02-17,2.0,1,14,14,sony mdrnc20 noise canceling headphones with foldable headband,i have had these for almost two years and i have found that they do not hold up well  the padding in the ears has flattened totally making them very uncomfortable  the headphone cord has become stiff so that i have to bend it away from my face  the biggest problem that has developed is creakyness  the headphones creak anytime you move  the creaking is loud and unpleasant and resonates inside the headphones  if you are trying to wear them while sleeping on a plane the creaking sound is very disturbing br  br the noise cancelling is good on a plane and the sound is good considering the price  however i would not buy them again because they have aged poorly
2013-03-15,5.0,1,5,5,sony mdrv6 monitor series headphones with ccaw voice coil,as a hobbyist of home recording applications and music listening i must say this meets all fields for a great music experience  my review will start off with the listening experience and then i will go with recording applicationsbr br as a person who just likes listening to music ranging from mellow rb to upbeat trance the melodies come out very detailed and a person is able to tell that the mix is transparent  this probably wont suit people who listen to rap or hiphop music if they are looking for enriched bass in their music but even without settings you can still hear that the bass is punchy enough  however look no further if you like hearing music at its full detail determining what the mix engineers have done to fatten or thin out parts of the sound  as others reviewers mentioned nothing is colored which i do prefer as i see things from the engineering perspective  and yes a product that has started almost 30 years ago is still going strong therefore i cant recommend this product enough for those who appreciate music the way its designed to bebr br now as for recording applications i can understand why studios recommend the mdrv6 as their standards  i have always contemplated on owning stereo monitors akg maudio and the like but i did not have the space for that and didnt want to go over 200 just to get a pair of good and longlasting monitors  as i have done my research i was happy to find that this pair is the best bang for buck after seeing the sony store about 60 miles away from where i live carrying the product for 88 plus tax i knew that amazon had the best deal and therefore grabbed a pair from them  i have just done and completed a mix then master of a track making it as transparent as possible for all speakers and am very impressed with the results since i was able to adjust the fatness or thinness of sound without exaggerations what you seehear is what you get  therefore for those who like todo home recording i highly recommend this product as it will help you get the best transparent sound that you are looking forbr br with all of that said i hope this review gives an idea for those thinking about purchasing this product  also please be sure to purchase directly from amazon if ordering online as this product has been counterfeited many times  google and you will understand
2003-07-16,2.0,1,13,16,sony mdrv700dj djstyle monitor series headphones old version,these will break on you very quickly  believe me  im a dj thats given up and decided to go to the 280s  what happens is that in a short period and even after taken care of these the swivel cupsplastic thing will crack and break and the cups will no longer fit closely to your headthey will then be useless and since this usually happens shortly after a year you will no longer have your mfrs warrantybr countless other djs will tell you the same thing save your money and get something better  the hd 280s sound better fit better and give you more value for your money  they are cheaper and parts are easily available and easily replaceableunlike sonys 700s  do the right thing dont buy these youll be happy you listened to my advice

2012-05-02,4.0,1,0,0,sony mdrxd100 stereo headphones,as a music producer these allow me to hear the clarity of every beat and soundbr by jessie houston texas usbr br   i have read a couple pages of reviews and agree with most  the plastic is very cheap feeling and will probly break them like my other old sonys however the lack of bass i cannot agree with  these phones produce a very clean flat signal and the bass is reproduced perfectly so possibly i ended up with a defective pair that rocks or most people are listening and expecting the phones to have a bass boost which is terrible when you are mixing and listening for a final mixdown to be played on other systems granted for music production im sure there are much better choices but for the 20 bucks im more than happybr br  overall if you want a low cost pair of phones to get you by in a jam i would recomend the xd100 im sure they work great for general listening and for anyone mixing music and needs to hear frequency changes and an uncolored flat signal these phones are greatbr br   another note these are not noise cancelling phones good and bad you can hear yourself when you talk so you are not yelling at everyone and you can hear your gf without having to take them off every couple minutes when she talks lol however they do not block out other sounds in the room if that is what you are looking for you want to buy noise cancelling headphonesbr br i would often take them on and off just to make sure that i had the speakers turned to headphones because the sound was so clear that i could swear id forgotten and it was filling the whole room i usually watch movies at night so i dont want to wake anyone up  lmao  done that once or twice  d

2015-02-17,1.0,1,0,1,sony mdr10rncip ipadiphoneipod noisecanceling wired headphones black,i have had these headphones for over a year now throughout that time when the noise cancelling is turned on a faint radio signal comes through the headphones  when i am in the city the signal is louder this makes the noise cancelling ability unusable love the headphones but this issue makes them ridiculous to buybr br besides this feature they are fantastic  i have three pairs of the older noise cancelling headphone for my three sons they love them  never had a problem besides this  wish this problem could be resolved for future headphones
2014-03-07,1.0,1,1,1,sony mdrex10lp inear headphones,when this product first arrived it worked really well the bass was great for an earbud and the aesthetic quality was also top notchbr br however after about a week of use the right earbud stopped working entirely normally this is something id expect over months of use as the wires become threadbare in this case the earbuds look perfectly fine from the outside no damage to the wire no water damage nothing this is undoubtedly an issue with the interior quality of the productbr br i will not buy this product again this is very disappointing
2014-08-06,2.0,1,0,0,sony mdrex40lp inear headphones,ive had many pairs of these sony buds because they fit great are reasonably priced and usually last for a few months of normal use for me maybe 2 hours a day 5 days a week this time i bought 2 pairs of the pink ones shown in the photo they are slightly different in that the earpiece isnt a round 34bud34 but more of a coneshaped thing it still fits fine and they sounded the same as ever so i wasnt concerned after a couple of weeks of the usual type of use the first pair stopped working in one ear so i tried the other pairsame thing the left side would start to crackle then static then go dead whats up with that  even though ive always liked them i cant really trust the quality anymore so i would not recommend them
2014-02-01,4.0,1,0,0,sony mdrnc200d digital noisecanceling headphones discontinued by manufacturer,theyre not great on bass theyre pretty good on the mids the sound cancelling is good but not great overall worth the price but dont expect too much from them theyre not the bose headphones

2013-03-02,5.0,2,0,0,sony mdrzx100 headphones,used for flights and noisier areas where apple ear buds couldnt would recommend for the price and i got a pair for my wife tooive been using earbuds for years and i hated it the sound quality was horrible and i hated having them in my ear i looked into lots of headphones on amazon and decided on these these are so great now im no headphone or sound expert but the sound quality is so much better im hearing parts of the songs that i didnt hear while using earbuds the only con is that it doesnt tremendously get rid of background noise unless you crank up the volume but if you dont want to spend a lot of money on headphones i highly recommend these

2008-05-22,4.0,1,5,6,sony mdrex75whi ex earbuds headphones with 9mm hisensitivity driver,ive gone through about 6 pairs earbuds in the past 4 years but these mdrex75 earbuds from sony are by far the best that ive had and whats surprising is that they are one of the least expensive the fact is a lot of sonys earbuds are superior to many of the competitors if you are looking for a wide frequencey response wide frequencey response generally means lower bass and higher treble this makes for a more dynamic listening experience these mdrex75s are no exception to sonys tradition of wide frequency response in this case the earbuds have a range of 6 hz to 23 khz most competitors earbuds are typically 20hz  20khz and rarely do they go below 10hz let alone 6hz which is what these earbuds can go to  what i really like about these earbuds is that i can actually hear the bass coming out of my 80gb ipod classic with other earbuds ive had the bass was just barely noticeable and compared to other earbuds the overall sound quality is much better i originally had the bass freq earbuds made by vmoda and while those earbuds definitely were bassheavy the sound quality was slightly harsh compared to the mdrex75 the mdrex75 is also similiar to sonys cheaper model the mdrex51lp about 1020 cheaper the difference being that the cheaper model doesnt sound quite as clear or crisp  but the difference between the two is barely noticeable so if you want about 90 performance of these for half the price then get the mdrex51lp and save yourself about 20 but if you are willing to spend a bit more then the mdrex75 should be on your list

2005-09-28,3.0,2,4,6,sony ntm910 900 mhz babycall nursery monitor ntm910,this is the first and only monitor we bought based on a recommendation from friends and we could not be happier with it  it goes on only when there is sound in the room so you do not hear the constant buzzing and static that our other friends complain of with their monitors  it is sensitive enough to pick up all baby sounds  we can hear our baby cry and wimper or just goo and gaa we even broke out laughing one night when the monitor went on the the sound of a large baby fart   br we have had no problem with the out of range alarm and we have a decent size house about 2500 sq ft i have even carried it outside while mowing the lawn and the alarm did not go off  i would recommend this monitor to anyone  in fact my sister in law just got one for her third child after being disappointed with the monitors for her first 2 childrenplease do not get this monitor  it does not work half of the time  my son would be down the hall crying his head off and the monitor would not register any noise what so ever  the out of range alarm would go off all the time too even though the monitor is only about two doors down from the receiver  my friend has the same monitor and she has the same problems  this monitor is not worth the price  get a cheaper one because you only need it for a few months  once the baby starts to sleep through the night you dont need it anymore  save your money for all the other things a baby needs

2011-07-19,1.0,1,6,11,sony rmkz1 universal childrens remote control,i decided to do my research before purchasing this product  thankfully sony provides their manuals online  the instruction manual for this device says that it can control both a television and a set top box such as a cable box or a tivo    the problem is that the instructions have no information about how to program the code for the set top box  they are clear that you must do so and that you must do it in the proper order but nowhere in the instructions do they say how to do so  the instructions are also clear that if you type in a second code in the same manner as you typed in the first the first code will be erased    i spent nearly two hours with their online tech support people and was escalated all the way to tier 3 but still no one could answer how to enter the code for the second device  this might be a great product if you can get it to work but dont expect the instruction manual or the sony tech support people to tell you how to program it    edited to add  i was ultimately online with their tech support people for over 3 hours at which point their tier 3 tech support person told me that no matter what the instructions say this remote cannot control both a tv and a settop box such as a cable box or tivo  they were extremely adamant that the remote could not do such a thing  it turns out this is completely incorrect    if their own tech support people apparently know nothing at all about their products are their products worth buying

2009-08-12,5.0,1,24,24,sunbeam hdx23 sunbeam 12c coffeemaker,i have owned this about 6 months now and i couldnt be happier  design and performance are great  i love all of its conveniences from the removable water reservoir no more awkward reaching pouring or spilling to the permanent filter with removable and very easy to clean basket  the shower head sprayer that brews the coffee works wonderfully creating a fullbodied brew and finally it looks awesome on the counter  we get compliments quite frequently      some people have mentioned that it doesnt have a lot of high end features but it has all the ones ill ever need  for example it has the pause and pour feature so you can sneak a cup during brewing  it also has a very interesting clock with a timer on the front which doesnt reset every time theres a glitch in the power    i contemplated getting an insulated carafestyle coffee maker for a whileuntil i realized they dont have warming plates and you cant see how much coffee is inside this is important when desperate for the first cup and for knowing how much is left  friends with the insulated style have told me that their coffee comes out cooler than they would like because it is being stored in a cold vessel that steals quite a bit of its initial heat  i have since learned that its a good idea to heat up insulated carafes ahead of time with hot water  but having to do that would make the timer feature pretty useless  so in the end i decided to go with a regular glass carafe and warming plate and i purchased a separate insulated carafe that i can use as needed  this seems to fulfill all my coffee needs    on a side note there is another hdx23 listed on amazon but the picture is of a mr coffee machine and the descriptions and reviews do not match up  im pretty sure that there is a lot of confusion about that one and as a result i would not trust the reviews listed there  the sunbeam hdx23 looks exactly as the one pictured above and it is a great machine

2014-01-08,5.0,1,3,3,tecsun pl660 portable amfmlwair shortwave world band radio with single side band black,i am really enjoying this radio a year ago i purchased a kaito ka1103 i was not satisfied with its performance it had very poor reception on any band so it was returned and replaced with a grundig g3 globe traveler  the g3s reception was slightly better so i decided to keep it however its operation was anything but intuitive all of the sw bands stopped working after eight months after more searching and reading reviews i found the tecsun pl600 as soon as i received it i was impressed with its design and clean looks operation was easy and design was well thought out when i plugged my external antenna into it the same antenna i used for the other radios and turned it on i was surprised by how many more stations were received its performance was far superior to the other two radios audio fidelity is markedly good for a small radio i have been using if for several months now based on my experience i would definitely recommend it

2013-01-16,1.0,1,0,0,ultimate ears metrofi 220 noise isolating earphones,i was looking for noise isolating earphones to help me concentrate in a rather quiet office with a very noisy coworker i picked these up on recommendations from a few people and having decent reviews online i knew that after logitech purchased them quality had gone way down  and boy did itbr br these headphones were terrible every single movement was amplified through the cords the cords themselves were really low quality and also very annoying with how stiff they were when trying to contact ue i had a constant run around the plastic on the headphone felt really cheep toobr br the sound quality of these was not that impressive either i found it to be pretty metallic and sometimes to heavy on bassbr br i ended up purchasing the klipsch s4 series in ears and love them
2009-08-28,5.0,1,2,5,ultimate ears metrofi 220vi noise isolating earphones with microphone,im not sure i would have ever thought spending 80 or 90 on earphones could ever be a justifiable expense and to be fair i doubt i would have ever tried these absent the amazon vine program  however after experiencing the sound quality delivered by the ultimate ears metrofi 220vi earphones my opinion could have changed any more  these earphones deliver an experience across all ranges that can only be described as breathtaking  logitech indicates that the technological basis for these earphones comes from the equipment musicians use when performing live and i believe it as listening to music using them is akin to a live performance    i wish i was more of an audiophile so i could better express the technical aspects of these earphones but barring that the only comparison i can make is that the jump in sound quality is akin to going from cassette tapes to cds ie its not an incremental change but and entirely different way of experiencing music    my only complaint is a minor one the button that ostensibly can answer your phone or skip tracks did not work for me  i am fairly certain this is due to a compatibility issue i have a lg darerather than a technical defect but it is something to be aware of if this functionality is a determining factor in your purchase  that said i should emphasize that the microphone worked just fine i just just had to answer via the phone    while admittedly pricey the ultimate ears metrofi 220vi earphones are a product you will use without regret for a long time  when considering your purchase what it really comes down to is do you want mediocre performance on a product that you will have to replace every six months or outstanding performance that will last for years  after using these earphones i fall firmly in the latter camp    jake mohlman

2008-08-01,3.5,2,2,2,vmoda bass freq earbuds,this is my first pair of vmodas i have owned many pairs of headphones they typically end in some sort of gruesome death thus the quest for the decent 3000 headphonesbr br i would give these a 45 weighted on their cost but they are probably a 4 in the class of sub 5000 headphones the sound is not really linear really tuned for contemporary music not classical i listened to a bit of old jazz as well and they were decent but perhaps a little too round in the low end but it is too much perhaps to expect something truly linear for 3000br br as the name would imply the headphones have pronounced but acceptable nonboomy bass the way they accomplish this is clever the headset does not actually go completely into the ear canal as some other models do as a result part of the ear becomes a resonant chamber the long plastic piece where each headset wire comes out is there to keep someone from putting the headset too far in the earbr br so despite the dumb name and vmodas really silly web site these are actually a decent pair of earphones as with most transducers including speakers the sound of them will change over a period of time  a day or two of heavy use should do it the high end becomes a little less stridentbr br the headset themselves are made from lightweight but fairly sturdy plastic the headset wires are lightweight they come with 3 different sized earpieces be sure to try all three out as these headphones fit differently than many other inear headphonesbr br you should probably be looking at the sennheiser cx300 as well which are more well regardedbut i think these are surprisingly good as well  they have a different set of qualities  the bass freq has very good detail in the midrange which i wouldnt have expected  lots of little details pop out including acoustic music happy so fardidnt use it for more than 2 months before it start malfunctioning get something else

2011-01-21,2.0,1,0,0,vmoda vibe ii,these headphones produce good sound for the money but are difficult to operate the cord has a cloth wrapping on it that grabs at clothing and tangles easily the control button that skips songs is too small and is hard to find while exercising  the earphones seem to be of high quality materials but are heavy in the ears and hurt after about ten minutes of use
2008-01-07,4.0,1,8,8,vmoda vibe inear noiseisolating metal headphone,the product looks and feels better in your hands and ears than in the photographs  as far as sound quality i was concerned when i first listened to my ipod i plugged the ipod in to a power source adjusted the volume to approximately 34 of max and let them play i forgot about the break in and let them run for 2 full days when i tried the vmoda vibes again it was night and day  the sound stage was accurate and crisp and not peeked in the midrange  i dont know if the magic took the 2 full days or not because i did not listen at any point in the process  i cant comment on reliability other than no problems yet

2013-05-14,5.0,1,0,0,videosecu one pair of side clamping bookshelf speaker mounting bracket with swivel and tilt for large surrounding sound speakers ms56b 3lh,i been looking for an adjustable speaker mount after many weeks of scouring various sights i narrowed it down to these i have 4 pioneer spbs41lr loudspeakers as my surround speakers in my 71 setup the stands allow for very easy adjustment to fit almost any sizeshape of a bookshelf or largish speaker my speaker dimensions are 7934 200mm w by 137534 350mm h by 8734 220mm d weight 1025 lbs 47kg i noticed some reviews commenting on a lack of sturdiness i disagree two out of the four speakers are next to my laundry  water heater access the speakers get tappedhit with some frequency and i have had no issue i feel like this shouldnt  need to be said because of the size  weight normally associated with speakers used on these type stand but you have to drill into a stud they look great and allow for more than sufficient vertical  horizontal adjustments im very pleased with the fairly svelte construction all things considered a minor gripe i have is when using larger gauge wire such as 14 its tricky to retrieve the wire from inside the frame if you ran all your wires behind the wall like i didbr  i hope this helps

2013-07-02,4.0,1,0,0,wall mount surge protector with usb charger 3 outlets 918 joules graywhite,i consider myself to be a reasonably smart person i own every electronic on the market just about especially if it has a partially eaten apple on it  but this surge protector got the best of me  i bought it and once it came i unpacked it and let it sit for a while waiting for the next time i would travel and have need for it  when the time came i picked up the protector examined it and couldnt for the life of me figure out how to plug it in  i am so used to gadgets like this coming with several different plug in adapters ones that depend on what country you are in and i usually just toss those in a bag or a box and never need them again  so heres where it got confusing this protectors normal 3pronged plugin is completely covered with a piece of grey plastic that matches the grey on the side of the unit and i didnt realize that all i needed to do was simplypull it off  that is until i repurchased it only to find that there were no international adapters which then caused my normal common sense to kick in and like a normal person pull off the grey piece of concealing plastic and plug it in  at which point it worked great  so i do recommend the product for its convenience but dont be foiled by the fully encased 3prongs even though you know they are there if you didnt save the directions and didnt use it for a while after liberating it from the box you might forget how to get at them  not my proudest moment  anyway now i have 2

2007-02-24,5.0,2,27,31,weather alert radio 23 code acbatt power black,i really like this midland wr300 i have had some cheap weather radios in the past that had lousy reception but this one has a very clear signal i had absolutely no problem with the programming if you can set the date and time on a digital watch you should have no trouble if you follow the instructions which i think are quite good i especially like that i can turn off the alert for things i dont want to know about for example you may not want to be awakened for a flash flood watch if you live atop a hill the radio fits nicely on my nightstand along with a lamp phone and flashlight i also looked at the midland wr100 and decided that i would probably want to listen to the news after some alerts so i bought the wr300 with the built in amfm manual tuning is a slow process but you can preprogram 3 am and 3 fm stations i agree with some other posters that this is not a great amfm radio because it doesnt have search scan etc however it is a great weather radioalthough weve only had this for a short time i am very impressed i didnt find it at all difficult to program the beeps are a bit annoying but once set up i dont see when this would be a continous problem we got this strictly for the weather etc alert monitor not for the clockradio features thats just an added bonus its nice to have the local weather just a push button away and also to get the heads up for the severe weather in the area the siren when placed on high is loud enough to raise the dead which is good since my husband is hard of hearing and our home is large our power gets knocked out quite often since we live out in the country this will let us know exactly whats going on with the weatheretc since it is backed up with 4 aa batteries not included the threat of tornandos is our main concern if we have just 5 minutes notice it may be a just enough time needed to get to safety after checking different places this was the best price here on amazon you cant go wrong with the price and the free shipping im very happy with our choice and plan to purchase more for gifts

2015-03-08,5.0,1,3,5,winegard flatwave amped indoor amplified hdtv antenna fl5500y,i installed a flatwave amped antenna in a onestory house about 22 miles from the broadcasting stations the stations ranged from 267280 degrees running a scan with amplification the best location got 29 stations including subchannels the number and specific channels varied depending on where i located the antenna the frustrating point was that i could not get all the major stations with any one location i was ready to install a larger antenna in the garage or attic before i spend more money i wondered if i could get all the channels using two antennas i had an inexpensive homeworx flat antenna that did not work as well as the winegard i attached the winegard and homeworx antennas to a splitter in reverse running a scan i got a total of 38 stations including subchannels the winegard was installed vertically about 67 feet above the floor surprisingly i got the extra channels i wanted by installing the homeworx antenna horizontally about 3 feet above the floor since these flat antennas are so unobtrusive this is a simple way to get more channels without installing something more cumbersome

2014-04-06,4.0,1,4,5,winegard hdtv antenna,just put this baby up on the side of the house elevated to 18 feet  its compact enough to put it in the attic and it will work fine if you are within the range of the antenna since im about 60 miles south of tampa i had to put it up on the roof and also installed an rca pre amplifier this baby works very nice at the 60 mile distance when pointing towards the northern transmitters however at this distance during the summer season there will be some fluctuations of signal strength due to weather variations but during the winter the signal will be steady all the time at least this has been my experiencebr br the construction is very sturdy and is us built you can put this together in about 15 minutes be very careful when assembling the built in transformer the housing must snap together and the clips must make contact when snapped damage to the clips can occur if not done properly making this antenna useless if not careful
2014-10-20,5.0,1,0,0,winegard hdtv antenna,i have 125 of cable from the roof antenna to the tv  i was getting 01 bars out of 5 of signal strength on some of my weaker stations  after intallation of the preamp i was getting 45 bars and no more pixelation  i went from getting 80 channels to 100 channels

2009-02-17,4.0,1,2,2,wolverine esp 80 gb portable multimedia storage player,the main selling point of the esp is its ability to back up and store photos from a flash card and seems to be mainly marketed as a storage device for photographers  with that in mind i should preface this review by saying that i really only use it as a portable media player and dont have much to say about its other featuresbr br with a variety of slicker mp3 players on the market this one may seem like an odd choice  its size alone make it difficult to see how this could compete with an ipod  theres really one feature of this player that led me to choose it over other models and it has to do with transferring files  most mp3 players that come out today require special software to load anything to them and rather than just importing everything manually they have this rather annoying system of synchronizing  the wolverine needs nothing more than a driver which my computer was able to install automatically it shows up as an external hard drive you drag and drop your files and they show up on the player itself exactly as they would in say windows explorer  a nice consequence of this is that unlike the ipod the esp can transfer files to and from any computer without any kind of file protectionbr br this may not be as important to some but it was really the selling point for me  its not easy to find players that are configured this way  there are a few notable inconveniencesbr br playlists have to be assembled manually which means if you wanted to put your entire library on shuffle youd have to build a play all playlist  this is not particularly difficult you can just put it together on your favorite media player and load it onto the esp as an m3u  still a lot of people will not want to go to the troublebr br the image quality is superb which is great for looking at still pictures  however the video frame rate is rather choppy which may be a problem for those who want to watch video from the esp  if you can look past the frame rate you can play videos through your tv via the included av cables  the internal mic has decent sound quality  about the same as your average builtin computer micbr br it also comes with tetris cleverly renamed matrixbr br a note on durability i had this player for about 10 months when the joystick started to come loose  about another 2 and it stopped working altogether  bear in mind im rather clumsy and its life probably could have been prolonged by dropping it a few less times  i was able to have it repaired by sending it back to the manufacturer  they didnt charge too much but the service was slow  it took over a month to get it back  if youre planning on travelling a lot with this definitely get the warranty for itbr br generally the esp is a tradeoff of convenience for versatility  you can do almost anything you want with it but its more of a hassle for me it was worth it but it probably wont be for everyone and honestly if a player came out that gave the user the kind of freedome i want and had a little more ease of use id ditch this for it in a heartbeatrate you can play videos through your tv via the included av cables  the internal mic has decent sound quality  about the same as your average builtin computer mic      it also comes with tetris cleverly renamed matrix    a note on durability i had this player for about 10 months when the joystick started to come loose  about another 2 and it stopped working altogether  bear in mind im rather clumsy and its life probably could have been prolonged by dropping it a few less times  i was able to have it repaired by sending it back to the manufacturer  they didnt charge too much but the service was slow  it took over a month to get it back  if youre planning on travelling a lot with this definitely get the warranty for it    generally the esp is a tradeoff of convenience for versatility  you can do almost anything you want with it but its more of a hassle for me it was worth it but it probably wont be for everyone and honestly if a player came out that gave the user the kind of freedome i want and had a little more ease of use id ditch this for it in a heartbeat

2013-02-17,5.0,1,11,11,yamaha r stereo receiver,after reading many reviews and researching several different 2 channel receivers i decided to go with the yamaha rs700 to be honest even though many of the reviews claimed to provide dramatic improvements in total sound quality i was skeptic ive never been happier to be wrong i also purchased the yamaha 600 cd player i have owned bose 901 speakers for many years and they have never sounded better i really do hear things in my cds that i hadnt before

2011-10-15,1.0,1,33,45,zazus002577,i have a monitor which i occasionally use as a primary display asinb004r5slog asus ml249h 24inch led monitor black when connected to my laptop asinb004x5yc9i asus n53sva2 156inch versatile entertainment laptop silver aluminum via hdmi i decided to connect a high definition cable box to the monitor to view television programming when not used as a laptop monitor since the monitor only has one hdmi input that created the need for a product of this typebr br i decided on this product because the autoswitching capability was complimented by the manual selector switch amazons prime membership ensured a prompt delivery i connected the pigtail to my monitor and plugged the cable box into slot 2 and the laptop into slot 1 my thought process was that the laptop would occasionally be powered off and the autoswitcher would default to the cable box conversely when i powered on the laptop the autoswitching capability would default to the laptop in slot 1 my experience is as followsbr br i powered on both devices and the laptop was displayed on the monitor as expected i toggled the selector switch to input 2 and the cable box was displayed on the monitor once again as expected i put the selector back on slot 1 the laptop and then powered it off the switch did not default back to slot one instead the led alternated a blinking pattern between slot one and two i tried to manually select input 2 with the switch and the blinking just continued with no display on the monitor i powered up the laptop and once again the laptop was displayed on the monitorbr br i tried many steps to troubleshoot the issue amongst them i tried just plugging one device into slot 1 while leaving slots 2  3 empty once again there was alternating blinking of the led and no display on the monitor i tried this with just the laptop then just the cable box both attempts did not provide any display on the monitor at this point iconcluded that the hdmi switch device needs to have a minimum of two active hdmi power sources to function i did try switching the inputs and achieved the same resultsbr br as a last ditch effort before returning the product i plugged the laptop into slot 1 and the cable box into slot 2 i put the selector switch on slot 2 the cable box it displayed as expected i then powered down the laptop and the cable box continued to display hooray for me or so i thought i then turned off the cable box when i turned the cable box back on there was no display on the monitor the only way i could get the monitor to display again was to power on the laptop then i could use the selector switch to select the cable box thinking my monitor could be the culprit i tried the same configurations using a hd television as well asinb004m8scjm panasonic viera tcp50s30 50inch 1080p plasma hdtv the results were the samebr at this point i believed that i have a defective switch at a minimum the switch should work with only one input plugged into it i contacted the wonderful customer service staff at amazon to facilitate an exchange the exchange arrives promptly but upon opening the package i notice that the pigtail is slightly detached from the housing of the unit it just looked unsafe for a product designed to carry an electrical current no matter how small i didnt bother to use the second item i just returned it i have included a picture of the second product i am currently searching elsewhere for a product that suits my needs and works properly thanks for taking the time to read my review

2013-07-08,5.0,1,0,0,zvox 4002201 audio zbase 220 lowprofile single cabinet sound system,i purchased the zvox 220 sound system so i wouldnt have to turn on my stereo system every time i was listening to a program involving music or sound effects  while not as good as my 5k audio system with its tube amplifier the zvox is an adequate replacement  the voices are clear and the music including bass is more  than adequate  i especially like the feature that automatically reduces the sound levels on commercials  it goes into standby automatically so there is nothing to switch off  turning it on requires pressing one button either mute or volumebr br the only quibble i have is that the toslink input is a bit hitormiss  it worked with a generic toslink cable but not with an upgraded cable  i disconnected the toslink cable altogether  im using the analog rca outs from my tv to the rca in on the zvox  in this setup the sound as noted above is more than satisfactory  i rate it a 5 for convenience and a 45 for sound  the only deduction is for the toslink
2014-08-21,3.0,1,0,1,zvox 430hsd highperformance singlecabinet surround sound system with optical and coaxial digital inputs,i was not familiar with soundbars before purchasing the zvox i wanted 34the surround sound34 without all of the components and in a neat look for a small area i am a bit disappointed i believe my expectations influenced by other reviews were to high

2014-01-30,4.0,1,5,6,zy hifi cable sennheiser hd650 hd600 hd580 hd525 hd565 headphone upgrade hifi cable zy005,i love my hd600s and listen to them at my desk almost every day often for hours the headphones themselves are fantastic  the stock cables though have not been great for me  they seem to break or get flaky on me every couple yearsbr br i am glad others are saying they hear a difference  other than the sound no longer cutting in and out in one ear im not sure i am but neither am i sure im not  having to swap out 3 connectors at a time doesnt really make for a reliable ab test  it doesnt really matter to me though because thats not why i bought thesebr br what im hoping is just that this cable will last longer than the other ones  im optimistic  first its shorter and i think that will help because the extra length on the stock cable was long enough to fairly often drop to the floor and get rolled under my chair  second the connectors on both ends feel more solid and are definitely larger  if you are fashion conscious make sure you are ok with the beefy plugs that will be very visible under your ears  the wire itself does not seem any larger in diameter but it does have a tougher braidedlike exterior that perhaps will better resist any contactsbr br overall my initial impressions are good  i wish i could have obtained something like this for less could it really cost that much to make but if it ends up not breaking on me ill be happy i spent the extra money

2008-02-26,5.0,1,4,4,iriver s10 2 gb multimedia player black,ive owned this now for almost a year  its not distributed in the us at least not very widely  the interface is intuitive and the display is vibrant  its tiny and light enough to not really need a case of any kind but an armband would be nice if it existed  supposedly iriver is coming out with a wrist band style one but who knows    the headphones that come with it arent great but do have a very handy holder that clips securely to the player  i can go running with this easily by turning it around so the player is behind me  the fm tuner is surprisingly good and lets me listen to tvs at the gym if i get bored with music    a big pro for me is that it shows up as a simple mass storage device when you plug it into your computer  then you simply drag files to it  works like a charm in windows linux and mac  no silly software or drm requirements  you can optionally use the iriver plus software to manage it but it is not necessary  double bonus is that its also a 2g memory stick    a few technical notes be sure to upgrade to the latest firmware to get access to better volume battery life and playback options  cruise the internet a bit and you can find software that will let you put custom backgrounds and interfaces on it very cool stuff  it will also enable you to use any of your existing playlists automatically  search for iriver h3mod to find it    probably the best part of this player is letting people play with it  everyone is fascinated by this little guy  its a quality device with better features than the competing ipod shuffle and an excellent display
